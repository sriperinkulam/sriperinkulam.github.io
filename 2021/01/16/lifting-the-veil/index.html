Just about a decade ago, we leased a property on a pristine and desolate beach. The house didn&rsquo;t have robust walls - It just had a few curtains to protect us from the elements. The rooms internally had walls full of transparent glass. It was a beautiful property with lots of cross-ventilation and something that was just right for our family.
