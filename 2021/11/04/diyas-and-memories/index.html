It’s been 21 years and it feels just yesterday we were on that hospital terrace watching fireworks during her last Diwali. But then to think of it, nothing really is the same as before. The celebration across the colony is heavily dampened. Those old neighbors have moved out. Folks now use digital lights if at all they do light up their houses. Barely anyone is actually bursting fire crackers. In essence, it feels like the spirit of celebration is quite diluted for whatever reason. Time flies and I’m glad some memories remain etched.\nHappy Diwali to you and your loved ones.
