Here’s a quick rewind:\nJanuary:\nInterned at Deloitte for two months. My first actuarial internship and a great start to the year. February:\nAttended the SOA Hartford Student Connect. Great drive to the ‘Insurance capital of the world’ and a good day spent meeting practicing actuaries. Bought a new bike - my first ever road bike! [icon name=“bicycle” class=\"\"] March:\nInterned at Atikus Insurance. Wonderful bunch of folks and great learning insights. Dabbled with macros the first time on a major project. Went Seal watching and met an incredible champion. Bike ride around Central Park. Drove to Toronto during the spring break. Ithaca en-route, was a pleasant surprise.[icon name=“road” class=\"\"] April:\nFun road trip to Florida with the Bhaskars and a good time with the Nandurs. Back to running after a long break. Ankle feels good but not yet ready for a Half. May:\nDecided not to run my first registered half-marathon in the US. Though extremely disappointed, I’ll learn later the sacrifice was worth it. Meena runs a 10k and a few in the familia run halfs. If reactions post-run are any indicative, looks like I missed a lot of good-pain. Nevertheless, had a fun time just being there. The Baltimore family moves. Daphne welcomes us earlier than anticipated! June:\nMeena moves to Chicago for the TFA institute. Atikus and serious exam prep keeps me busy. Passed the second actuarial exam. This one was long due! [icon name=“flag” class=\"\"] July:\nFlew to Chicago for our second anniversary. The windy city doesn’t disappoint us! Drove the Jeep to NY. Ohio stretch was a pain with heavy road maintenance and blinding trucks. Loved the Philly stretch though! [icon name=“car” class=\"\"] August:\nFamily drives over a weekend to Florida for nephew’s first birthday. Crazy yet happening weekend! September:\nProbably one of my best running moments. Ragnar was such an experience! My first ever relay run over 200 miles. These pristine routes call for a revisit! October:\nFall session creeps in with project deadlines almost every other day. Boy, this semester has been relentless! The Family is going places, this time to Jason. Read “Deep: Freediving and What the Ocean Tells Us about Ourselves” by James Nestor. The urge to scuba dive… November:\nThe runners group [read Ragnar team] decides to go all in for the Philly Marathon. Cave-in to the ‘runner’s pressure’ and sign-up. Had a pretty decent run but decided not to run any more city runs. Swimming sessions at the Y. With the wife as the coach, life can be a bit under-water! The Philly run ends with news on the line on a new entrant in the family. Nieces galore! This one seems to be born with a bunch of butterflies. Exciting times ahead! The graduation heat is On! December:\nWait, the family is not yet done moving. This time to Ambiance! Burning the midnight oil (The heater?) for the finals. You can’t really avoid those last-minute surprises. Can you? All said and done, I now hold a Master of Science! - One long-held desire, Checked.[icon name=“university” class=\"\"] Last minute Christmas packing frenzy. Love this time of the year.
