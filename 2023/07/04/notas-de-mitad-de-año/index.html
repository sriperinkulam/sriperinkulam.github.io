I&rsquo;ve posted a few micro posts now and then, but nowhere close to chronicling things as much as I&rsquo;d like to. This is a quick run down of a few things occupying my mind space:
It&rsquo;s been about four months since we moved to Mexico City. We absolutely love it here. People are terrific, weather is just right, and this city&rsquo;s got a dash of almost every city we&rsquo;ve lived in so far! M&amp;S have been able to explore the regular tourist spots thanks to the CLO trips. I&rsquo;ve joined them for a few, but what I really enjoy is just experiencing the city for what it&rsquo;s got to offer - And there&rsquo;s no dearth to that. Absolutely blown away by the city planning and the presence of so many parks. The city is spectacularly clean for the number of people living here. Every Sunday one of the main avenues is closed out to vehicular traffic and opened out to runners, cyclists and essentially anybody who wants to enjoy the roads. Amazed at the resources that the local government is able to draw from to sustain this every single weekend! We haven&rsquo;t been that lucky to find decent vegetarian food here. Most local restaurants offer some form of meat in almost all dishes and the vegetarian items are rarely tasty. Dining out definitely leaves a lot to be desired - unless of course you try out other cuisines. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s good food out there - yet to find it though."><meta name=author content="map[email:ssp+hugo[at]srkn.anonaddy.com name:Srikanth Perinkulam nick:SSP]"><link rel=canonical href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/07/04/notas-de-mitad-de-a%C3%B1o/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.7dce516bbfe83c4258221b4a0f8c0c77b2125cc7187fc8e69ac2310eefc320bf.css integrity="sha256-fc5Ra7/oPEJYIhtKD4wMd7ISXMcYf8jmmsIxDu/DIL8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/images/favicon/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/images/favicon/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/images/favicon/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/images/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/07/04/notas-de-mitad-de-a%C3%B1o/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><link rel=webmention href=https://webmention.io/srikanthperinkulam.com/webmention><link rel=alternate type=text/mf2+html href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/hfeed><script data-goatcounter=https://ssp.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script><meta property="og:title" content="Notas de mitad de año"><meta property="og:description" content="With quite a few things constantly evolving over the last several months, I haven&rsquo;t actively paid much attention to this space.
