Wordpress has been one beautiful tool to rant and rave at my whims. It gave me the reconfigurability which Blogger didn’t match ( and I believe it still doesn’t !), the flexibility that I could deploy when required, the aesthetic appeal that I wanted to personify on my space, and Oh yes the always responsive support team that I believe none of the other competitors of Wordpress are even close to! Be it the stats page or the widgets corner; the lucid variety of themes or the anti spam Akismet utility, the going’s been fabulous.

Browmith: Dude! Where’ve you been ? We’ve been trying to reach you right from noon.
Me: Oh! is it? I was a bit occupied in a session.
Br: Session? What session? Today’s Saturday!
Me: Oh Yeah! There was a small meet at Microsoft and I was invited.
Br: Microsoft? What the heck were you screwing at MS? And they… INVITED you?

I was scouting for something on those lines when I chanced up on this site. Looked pretty interesting!!
Have a look at the document below. Check the Book view mode- looks real cool :-)

A few minutes later I get a call from him informing that he just had a bad fall and would not be able to join us for the trip. A pity that that he couldn’t join us!

And oh yes! It’s the first ever play I’ve watched live :-) .
I’d blocked four tickets on saturday evening for the show but later had to cancel two as Adi and Abhi had to drop out. Though the show was scheduled to start at 3:30 pm , it had to be delayed due to a few technical glitches. In fact it was a wonderful stroke of luck for me :-) . I was caught in a traffic jam at 3:25pm and made it to the theater only around 3:55pm. Suysh had luckily arrived a bit early and purchased the tickets well before I was there!
