      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so glad I moved out of the Apple ecosystem a few years back. Was good while I was using it and now that I&amp;rsquo;m off, I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow or have the urge to upgrade to the next in-thing. It is liberating and I guess - to each his own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely love such &amp;lsquo;meandering&amp;rsquo; posts! You never know what you&amp;rsquo;re going to be reading in the next para and the heading can only do justice to a specific section.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meandering through &lt;a href=&#34;https://berthub.eu/index.html&#34;&gt;Bert&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s webpage and a few other sites - Such a treasure trove of information on the C-19 vaccine and biology/technology in general. No seriously, dive into these links for some great layman(ish) explanation of DNA, RNA, Vaccines and what not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3c8962f2a2.96282489&#34;&gt;Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea38322bb2a0.08041300&#34;&gt;No, Really, mRNA Vaccines Are Not Going To Affect Your DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: These links point to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;Wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d much prefer linking to the original article. However, I find this as a good way to save information which I can access later even if the original source vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christmas plan for this year was a major blooper. With the long weekend and everybody off work, we had initially planned to head down south to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covelong&#34;&gt;Covelong&lt;/a&gt;. The sisters and I would take on surfing classes while my in-laws and Shasta would have some down-time by the beach. We&amp;rsquo;d scoped out Sea la vie, as a decent place to stay during the three days there and confirmed they had sufficient C-19 measures in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on reaching there on the 25th Morning, we were appalled at the lack of basic containment measures. None of the guests and even more alarmingly - none of the staff were wearing masks or taking any preventive measures. We immediately cancelled our stay there and head over to Fishermans&amp;rsquo; cove to check if they&amp;rsquo;d have any rooms available - which they obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t! Got a few beverages, spent some time on the beach and head back home stopping over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://annalakshmichennai.com/&#34;&gt;Annalakshmi&lt;/a&gt; for a delectable and sumptuous lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a terrific intro to all things linux and the terminal. Something I wish I&amp;rsquo;d come across when I was learning the ropes several years ago. I&amp;rsquo;d almost forgotten about &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I chanced on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web&#34;&gt;Calibre-Web&lt;/a&gt; last week and finally got around better organizing my book collection. I really like the way it&amp;rsquo;s turned out and if anything, this has been a silent nudge to read more and read frequently! The beauty of this is that, I can now share my collection with friends and family just like yesteryear&amp;rsquo;s - when you would just borrow a book from a friend, read it and return it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection is now available here - &lt;a href=&#34;https://lib.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;The Perinkulam Library&lt;/a&gt;. If there&amp;rsquo;s a book that you find interesting, let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to setup a guest account for you to read!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had to turn on images in a particular e-mail to read a specific piece of content which I thought was interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s alarming and rather obscene how images are used in certain newsletters to convey a simple wall of text. Thanks, no thanks - I&amp;rsquo;m unsubscribing right away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we&amp;rsquo;re on that topic, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://postale.io/&#34;&gt;postale.io&lt;/a&gt; for about a couple months now and absolutely love it! Setting it up was a breeze and the web-front is refreshingly clean!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/11/01/encrypting-drives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier last week one of my external hard-disks went kaput. Though it&amp;rsquo;s fair to assume the recent travel could have led to this, my guess is that it was just a case of an ill-fated drive. While I did lose all the data on that drive, I thankfully had duplicate copies of the over 200GB data on other drives or machines. This is the first time that I&amp;rsquo;m losing a hard-drive and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I was prudent enough to have multiple copies. All thanks to the folks over at Backblaze who frequently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/category/cloud-storage/hard-drive-stats/&#34;&gt;publish hard-drive failure statistics&lt;/a&gt; on their stock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/20201017_100233-1200x1200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, losing that data got me thinking if I was really wise in just storing that data naked without any encryption. If I did want to claim the warranty on the drive, I will have to send over the hard-drive to Seagate. I am just not comfortable sending it over now since technically, most if not all of it, can be forensically retrieved. On that thought while researching on possible encryption tools, I landed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.veracrypt.fr/&#34;&gt;VeraCrypt&lt;/a&gt;. I instantly formatted my backup drives, setup an encrypted container and pointed my selfhosted Nextcloud installation to that virtual &amp;lsquo;drive&amp;rsquo;. The initial formatting does take time since VeraCrypt replaces data bit-by-bit and creates a clean slate. Once that is done, decrypting the data is just a matter of seconds. While at it, I also subjected all my other hard-drives to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.&#34;&gt;SMART&lt;/a&gt; tests and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badblocks&#34;&gt;badblock&lt;/a&gt; tests to make sure they were following suit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about two weeks and I am super impressed with the ease and functionality of Veracrypt. It definitely is an additional step in the workflow. However, as they say - Privacy comes at a cost and I am willing to go that extra mile for an overall peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly getting back into the workout rhythm. With the Gym mostly all to myself in the USG housing, I&amp;rsquo;ve started rowing on the Erg. and also incorporated a few treadmill runs. Need to add in a few Ashtanga days and some long outdoor runs or bike rides during the weekend to add more flavor!&lt;/p&gt;
