      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got some decent progress on tweaking this portal. All hugo&amp;rsquo;d out for now though and a short break is overdue. Super slow weekend otherwise. Watched Moana 2. Meh. Not much story but decent visuals. Tragedy of sequels, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moved over the syndication links in my posts to post-meta. The syndication icon only shows up if a valid link is present in the FrontMatter of a post. Once micro.blog picks up the feed, it&amp;rsquo;s currently set to auto publish to the fediverse on my GoToSocial (GTS) instance.  On the backend, a GO script fetches the RSS feed from my GTS instance and saves the RSS feed item link and the corresponding link to my post in a JSON file. Another script quickly looks up which post&amp;rsquo;s FrontMatter needs to be updated for the syndication links in each post and updates the files as needed. A bit windy but seems to do the job for now. I might end up consolidating these into just one script later and/or directly use the masto API to publish to the fediverse and grab the syndication link from there. For now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty psyched this is all working.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just struck me that most of my disk drives are quite old. Almost all of them were salvaged from old laptops. Age does not necessarily equate to performance and I do have decent backups, but only a question of time before I see them going kaput. Living vicariously on the edge when it comes to self-hosting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I sent out a poll to the ESC group to gauge interest in a group hike at Nevado de Toluca. There was reasonable interest and we slotted this to be a family hike on the 24th. The Padilla&amp;rsquo;s and Johnston&amp;rsquo;s had to drop off last minute. It was just going to be Hadley and the Arturo&amp;rsquo;s now with the three of us. We reached the Shuttle point around 1015, hopped in a shuttle and got to the trail-head around 1100. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to hop off the shuttle - the gasoline stench coupled with the super dusty windy roads was more than churning my tummy. S did terrific with no complaints!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around we had to pay 65 pesos/person to enter the park. Very nominal and I guess it might be to control the crowd. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen Nevado de Toluca this busy! We trot up from the campamento towards Arista de Humboldt. I compromise with S before-hand that I&amp;rsquo;d carry her on sections when I can. Boy, she is getting heavy - &lt;em&gt;big and strong&lt;/em&gt; as M would like me to phrase it. We reach the viewpoint in no time.  This place is so freaking beautiful. Even with the almost ten fold crowd than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;AristaDeHumboldt.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houss is definitely feeling the altitude ~14,060 ft. M is slowly warming up and S wants to head back to the trailhead. We decide to split the group here. The girls head over to scale one of the shorter hills on the right while the three of us head up the steepish peak on the left. In about twenty five minutes we reach to the top of this knoll and decide to turn around. At about 14,550 ft. oddly, it was way warmer than the lower elevations. A quick trot down to the rim and we decide to head back to the trail-head. The shuttle back from the trail-head is in a beaten Chevy pickup truck. We&amp;rsquo;re smothered with loads of fine dust as it zooms down the hill. S takes a mini-nap and wakes up just as we reach the car parking spot. A quick hour and a half and we&amp;rsquo;re home for a slow Sunday catch-up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent a good few hours yesterday and ported my garmin data over to this site &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s turned out better than my wordpress plugin and is way simpler to manage. I&amp;rsquo;ve still got quite a few tweaks to do but I&amp;rsquo;m super happy with how this has turned out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;BacalarLagoon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cenote Negro&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacalar has been on our travel list for quite sometime now. Between work travel, syncing our individual schedules and just getting around to actually booking the trip; we finally get around visiting this beautiful place this weekend in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we get off the plane, we&amp;rsquo;re immediately hit by a waft of the Yucatán humidity, soon followed by thick droplets of rain. Strikes me just then that we&amp;rsquo;re also right in the midst of the hurricane season. A quick lookup on the weather forecast reveals Hurricane Sara would be swinging past us and into the Gulf of Mexico in a bit. I slap myself on my wrist for not doing any research beforehand but also shrug this &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; oversight very quickly. How bad could it actually be? Maybe some showers here and there? We walk outside the Chetumal airport for about 500m and take a taxi from the main road to Bacalar. Oscar offers to take us there for 550 pesos. This was about 50 pesos shy of the amount the tour planner had quoted. M immediately accepts and we&amp;rsquo;re on our way. First impressions of this place immediately remind me of Trivandrum - lush green vistas with coconut trees strewn all around, narrow roads and barely any traffic. There&amp;rsquo;s construction for Tren Maya happening along the route but it barely impacts our drive. In about 50 minutes we reach the hotel and check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S immediately comments on the smell of wood as we enter our room. She&amp;rsquo;s ambivalent of the smell but seems to love the room setup. She goes around exploring the windows and shower. Once we get settled in, we head out to explore the property a bit. Hotel Carolina looks good with the woodsy feel and being right on the lagoon - but it definitely feels more commercial than I had imagined it to be. Yet another slap on the wrist. Note to self not to go by just pictures next time around. Maybe this trip planner thing is not quite working for us? This is the first time in all these years we&amp;rsquo;re using one - An embassy colleague&amp;rsquo;s wife runs a dive business and plans trips for folks across central America. We thought we&amp;rsquo;d give her a shot for this trip. Anyways, the stomach rumbles and we head over to Mango y Chile - a quaint vegan restaurant right by &lt;em&gt;Fuerte de San Filipe&lt;/em&gt; about 30 minutes walk from the hotel. The burgers and smoothies here are super delicious and we finish it off with some paletas. M&amp;rsquo;s restaurant picks barely go wrong! Back to the room and we settle down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 0730 we stir awake and quickly get ready for the day. Plan is to head over to the fort to meet out boat captain who&amp;rsquo;s supposed to take us for a two hour ride in the lagoon. M messages the tour operator to check if the plan is still on since it&amp;rsquo;s super gloomy and heavy outside. She confirms and we head over to the fort. Just as we get to the fort, the skies let loose and the Boat captain gives us news that the police have closed the port for the day. We&amp;rsquo;re obviously disappointed and decide to grab a quick bite closer to the hotel. I offer to carry S on my shoulders as we make our way back in the pouring rain. The roads are flooded and the rain isn&amp;rsquo;t showing any signs of letting go. Love this walk back and it&amp;rsquo;s been quite sometime that we&amp;rsquo;ve actually done this! Some good breakfast at Noru&amp;rsquo;s and we make our way back to the hotel. M suggests we should probably consider getting back to CDMX that afternoon. Unfortunately, there are no tickets available on the flight. With that decision made for us, we decide to head back out for lunch at &lt;em&gt;Enamora&lt;/em&gt;. Food here&amp;rsquo;s okay. As we make our way back to the hotel, the weather clears up a bit. S wanted to head to the kids pool and we nudge her to try out the swing in the water. &lt;em&gt;Sara&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; effect lingers and the water is super choppy. We try getting the kayak out for a bit but aren&amp;rsquo;t quite successful. Back to the room and we spend some good time in the portico by the hammock. After we&amp;rsquo;re back from dinner at &lt;em&gt;Noru&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt;, I nudge S to head back to the wooden pier by the lagoon. We spend some time here as the sun sets and S plays with the idea of getting the kayak out. She flips it over in an instant and wants me to get in the water instead. The water does seem way calmer and I hop in to explore the waters. This impromptu wade in was probably one of the highlight&amp;rsquo;s for the day. We head back to the room. S spends some more time on the hammock and quickly falls asleep. M and I tinker with the idea of taking the kayak out the next morning to explore the lagoon by ourselves. As I type this at 0326 on Monday, I&amp;rsquo;m actually super psyched about this plan. Hoping S is game doing this in a few hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;BacalarSwing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she is! We quickly change over in the morning and take to the waters. The weather is just right - Dark clouds hanging above and rays of sunshine creeping down. The water is much calmer and we&amp;rsquo;re near Cenote Negro in no time. We wade in the waters for about an hour and steal a few more minutes by the swing. Around 1030 we finally checkout and head to the airport after a brief breakfast stop at &lt;em&gt;Ajal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to explore the whole lagoon, I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we ended up staying for the extra day. Overall S thoroughly enjoyed the water and just lazing in the hammock. Lesson learnt though that we are best at planning our own trips and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to head to Baja California later this December!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the Yucatan for a work trip. Too many variables to factor in and ultimately I decided to head here for just a couple days. Short but super productive. Nothing to beat some good facetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new building here is at a much better state than Hermosillo and we should be quite ready for the move next year. Spent about a day at the NCC and head back to the COB to close out a few things there. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite hungry but decided to walk over to a quaint place closeby. Barely anybody at this Puerto-Rican restaurant - Spanglish, but boy am I not glad I walked in? One of the best meals I&amp;rsquo;ve had here in Merida in a while. Salsa with some piping hot white rice served with some steaming hot platanos glazed with baked beans paste. Simple yet -potent- with flavors and spice. Surprised we did not quite visit this place over the last year. Coming back here for sure! Missed going to the Korean place this time around for the ice-cream. Spanglish more than made up for that though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As timing would have it, we&amp;rsquo;ll be back to the Yucatan this weekend for the Bacalar trip. This one&amp;rsquo;s been on our list for a while now and we are super looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;
