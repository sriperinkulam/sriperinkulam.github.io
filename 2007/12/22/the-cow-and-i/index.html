It was a common belief that syllabus in Math was much better in SSC schools when compared to ICSE ones and since my bro was in his seventh by then, people in my family wanted him to shift over to the state syllabus By default I had to tag along as no one ever trusted me, thanks to my consistent flunking in quite a few papers.

This was one standard composition that I’d been learning by rote for quite sometime in JGHS. Nevertheless, my written hindi was pathetic! Real pathetic! Bharathi Miss , the then Vice Princi evaluated my sheets right in front of me. I still remember that ‘WTH!’ reaction on her face when she was skimming through my composition. :-) .

All I wanted was to get back to the 5th bench of class VI-A the next day. But unfortunately Bharathi’s mind worked the other way round - If my bro was intelligent , there’s a high probability that his sibling would do just the same with some help. How could SVHS afford to lose such brilliant students? They’re in!. She comes out and tells my mom that though my Hindi was real bad, I’d be given admission. My bro’s admission stays granted without any hitches.\nUnder the persistent guidance of my Hindi teacher Mrs Sahani, I got a decent command on the language .
