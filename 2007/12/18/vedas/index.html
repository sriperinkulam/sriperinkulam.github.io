This was during my first year of engineering. What I was interested then was not in what I was saying, it was the way in which it was recited that lured me to it.

In fact there’s not one moment in the last seven years that I really felt like going to the place for clearing my conscience or relieving my tensions.\nWhat I don’t understand is if people believe so much in rushing to a temple to relax and pray before pushing off to their office; doing that ceremonious action with their hands when they come across a religious place while travelling in a vehicle or just drop by once a while, why don’t they do it the way the seers claim it has to be done? And if you tell me time is the factor. Please.. give me a break! If I though being an atheist, can recite a few slokas much better than quite a few people; can find time to ( if I want to that is!) go to spend some quality time at the place, why can’t you spend some time to do things the way it is to be righteously done?\nP.S: These are just my thoughts and I have no intentions to hurt your religious sentiments.
