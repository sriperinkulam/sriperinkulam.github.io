      <description>&lt;p&gt;25 years ago, I was much into collecting stamps. Somewhere along the road that kinda stagnated. Moved over that digitized collection to this portal &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazed at how well this &amp;lsquo;Paseo&amp;rsquo; is maintained! We were here in the morning on a weekend and there was barely anybody here. Word is also that this area is not really frequented by locals. Not even during the evenings. Wonder why though? This country&amp;rsquo;s got SO MUCH potential. The infrastructure is really good. Would be barely surprised if all of this is managed by a Chinese contracted firm. Definitely something to say about the merits of foreign influence.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/map&#34;&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; page to reflect posts that have a set location. Currently this is a super vanilla layout and I think I should cluster these by region. I do like how it&amp;rsquo;s turned out though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at it, I realised I missed downloading pictures from my old Flickr account to Nextcloud. Brought those in and nuked the Flickr account. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/03/maps/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup these three &lt;a href=&#34;https://meshtastic.org/&#34;&gt;meshtastic&lt;/a&gt; T1000-E radio&amp;rsquo;s today. Amazed at how tiny yet powerful these are. They seem to last for about three days with GPS and telemetry on. Until Meshtastic enables all the sensors I might probably box these up. In a pinch these can always be used for mesh&amp;rsquo;d comms if needed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/26/meshtastic/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d initially planned on visiting HongKong to celebrate Patti&amp;rsquo;s 80th and then head to India for a short trip for our R&amp;amp;R. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/04/stented/&#34;&gt;Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s heart decided nah-ah&lt;/a&gt; and we ended up in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/dubai&#34;&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/pune/&#34;&gt;Visiting Pune&lt;/a&gt; was most fulfilling. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ahmedabad&#34;&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/trivandrum&#34;&gt;Trivandrum&lt;/a&gt; to meet Raju Mama. Drive to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ernakulam&#34;&gt;Ernakulam&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/bangalore&#34;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; but the flying &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/madras&#34;&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; trip was one last minute surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&amp;rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!

      <title>Week with S</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/19/week-with-s/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a weird feeling. To not be presence-aware of someone 24x7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, S had either been with both M and I or just M when I travel for work. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to be with just S alone for a long stretch. Until last week. M&amp;amp;I thought it might be a good idea for her to travel with me from Dubai. It felt like she matured all of a sudden during Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s hospitalization. Maybe she sensed the stress all around her and adapted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As S traveled with me, zipping across 6 cities, I felt I was constantly on the hook. How much buffer time do I need to get her ready? Did she use the bathroom before we head out? Did I keep a spare set of clothes with me? Will I find the food that she might like in the new place? If not, did I have enough snack options for her? Do I need to get her clothes washed in this city or the next? Which PJ set would she like tonight? How do I coax her to sleep despite all the flux around her? What am I forgetting?&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to not do that, now that she isn&amp;rsquo;t with me, It feels odd. And then, when it actually dawns that M&amp;rsquo;s doing this more or less 24x7x365 - besides the gazillion other things she does; I think the least I can do is get involved a lot more.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last several days have been extremely trying on the family. Mummyjaan had a cardiac arrest on 27 June. She woke up that morning complaining of uneasiness and moving pain across her chest and back. We initially thought it was gas and I made my way to work, just as usual. S sent me an email at around 0800 mentioning the pain wasn&amp;rsquo;t subsiding and that we&amp;rsquo;d have to take her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health unit suggested we take her to the Central Hospital in Yaounde. Around 0815 she began sweating profusely and the pain only seemed to increase. Motorpool was called and we made it to the hospital in about 30 minutes. Took us about an hour to speak to the cardiologist and she confirmed it was an MI event. The hospital didn&amp;rsquo;t have a Cath lab so Thrombolysis was the next step to stabilise her. As luck would have it, the hospital did not have the block-buster drug needed to do the Thrombolysis. They mentioned the military hospital had it and the doctor was willing to come with us to get the drug. M went with the doctor since the doctor only spoke French, while we waited at the hospital. Once there,  M texted that she didn&amp;rsquo;t have the cash needed. 160k FCFA. Easy day. The hospital was generous enough to release the drug without initial payment. I head to the Military hospital to pay for the drug and the doctors in the Central Hospital started the treatment. Once I find the two nurses at the Military hospital, they walk me to the chief doctors&amp;rsquo; room that&amp;rsquo;s hidden all the way in one of the nooks of the hospital. Only there I realise, they wanted 1.6 Million FCFA and not 160k FCFA. That&amp;rsquo;s about 3000 USD and they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take credit card or USD either. I tell them I&amp;rsquo;ll have to get back with the funds and make my way out of the hospital. We barely had 500 USD equivalent FCFA in hand. The bank in the embassy was closed given it was a Friday. We reached out to as many people as we could and finally pooled enough money to cover the costs. M and I head back to the hospital handing over the wads of cash and hoping they stick to the deal. Probably the biggest sigh of relief I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a while walking away with that receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/CentralHospitalYND.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the hospital, the doctors mentioned the process was successful and she was recovering well. Not quite sure exactly when, but we glean from them that she did go into a cardiac shock after the drugs administration. Dobutamin was administered to support the heart. As we explore our next steps we realise we barely have any options left here in Cameroon. Family docs confirmed getting an Angio is the next course of action. There&amp;rsquo;s no cath lab nearby and we were nowhere confident about the post-op healthcare here. Meanwhile, over the weekend we have abysmally poor support or information from the nurses and doctors. They&amp;rsquo;re barely divulging any information and the ICU doctor apparently made the rounds but never spoke to us. We pull all possible strings we can. Jimmy Francis is able to get the President&amp;rsquo;s doctor visit the hospital and the embassy put some more pressure on the hospital to atleast give us as much information as they could. Things slowly improved a bit after this but we&amp;rsquo;re barely satisfied. The doctors seem to know their trade but there&amp;rsquo;s just so little infrastructure support. Their extremely slow pace of action and poor communication was beyond concerning. We decide to Medevac her as soon as we could mobilize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours of debating the pros and cons of medevacing her to Nairobi, Joberg, Morroco, Dubai and Chennai; we decided to get her to Dubai. It was monday evening already. The air ambulance needed 100% funds upfront and they also needed a confirmation letter from the receiving hospital that they would accept the patient. The Kuletha&amp;rsquo;s were exceptionally helpful in getting the legwork done for the Air-ambulance and the hospital admission in Dubai. Finally around 0200 on 01st July, we were able to get her medevac&amp;rsquo;d out of YaoundÃ©. Miss V and I head in the air ambulance with mummyjaan.  We make a technical stop in Nairobi and finally make it to Dubai that evening. Beyond glad, she handled the takeoffs and landings well. Once in Dubai, at Fakeeh University Hospital the moment we met and spoke to Dr. Sakib, I was convinced we were in safe hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days, under excellent observation and medical care, she recovered pretty well. On Friday, during the Angio, the doctors gave her a stent and reported the only artery that was blocked was the one that was serving the heart. We&amp;rsquo;d probably be looking at locomotive or cognitive impairment had it been somewhere else! So unluckily lucky! What a coincidence that she got her stent done on M&amp;rsquo;s birthday in the city that M was born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that bullet thwarted, I think we&amp;rsquo;d be remiss if we didn&amp;rsquo;t take some actionable steps. Need to get those baseline health checks in place. We&amp;rsquo;re going to stall anybody from visiting us until they have a Medevac insurance sorted out. I need to plan for more liquidity in my emergency funds given how cash-dependent this country is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has probably been the most stressful thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me in a while. Even when Amma was sick, I think I knew what to expect. We were sort of in a Catch22 situation here. The medical facilities weren&amp;rsquo;t quite kitted to handle cardiac issues and we had to stabilise her before we could even consider medevacing her for further care. Thankfully we had doctors in the family who were able to provide remote assistance and guided us with questions to ask. But for those vital family and friend connections, this could have ended up way differently&amp;hellip;So many things to be grateful for!&lt;/p&gt;
