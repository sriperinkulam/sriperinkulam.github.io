      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took an armored Land Cruiser out for a spin here on the hills and some dirt roads. SO MUCH FUN! It&amp;rsquo;s been several years that I&amp;rsquo;ve driven a stick-shift. Amazing how muscle memory just works.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bailing out to the new media - Will we though? In some form or fashion those that are leaving are probably just finding  a different medium where they&amp;rsquo;re able to connect better? I actually think there are more people blogging now than before. Just in different dispersed mediums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually if we do, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be just the ebbs and flows of a social framework? People come in, people leave. You make a connection here and a connection there and hope to linger in that ether of those network connections that&amp;rsquo;s always in a flux. Also isn&amp;rsquo;t blogging a sort of &amp;rsquo;new media&amp;rsquo; when compared to postcards or aerogram? When was the last time you sent or received one?&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/06/06/letting-go/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went out with CLO for a drive through of the city. The downtown market reminded us of the Nakasura market in Kampala and the Moazzam Jahi market in Secunderabad.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://withknown.com/&#34;&gt;WithKnown&lt;/a&gt; for about a minute several years ago. Loved the interface and software but it never really stood the test of time. Yesterday, while searching for older posts related to Uganda, I realized, I never quite moved those posts over. Spent about an hour yesterday and migrated those over to this portal. While at it, I also migrated my old twitter posts over. And with that I think all content is now present on this portal. Since the feed settings are limited to 10 most recent posts, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t spam the RSS feeds.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think I almost figured out how to have different feeds for tags and categories in Hugo! Modified the feed so the title is replaced with the publish date instead so feed readers display the content properly instead of just the title and a link to the post. Might still have a few kinks but I think we&amp;rsquo;re slowly getting there&amp;hellip;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was supposed to be a &amp;lsquo;Bridged&amp;rsquo; holiday. In this part of the world, the president apparently declares certain days to be holidays if they happen to fall adjacent to a previously declared public holiday and the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tomorrow being Cameroon day, rumor was that today would be one of those bridged holidays. Sadly it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Locally employed staff were definitely not happy. The Ambo did declare a 59 minute early release. Got the message while we were amidst a small project and not quite at a good stopping point. So we chugged along and head home when we were done. Will take it in spirit though. Merci Beaucoup! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/19/unbridged/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Malabo</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/15/malabo/</link>

      <guid>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/15/malabo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back from a work trip in Malabo. Got there last Thursday and worked through the weekend. We completed a minor site upgrade and completed almost all of the planned work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to explore any of the island since we were mostly shuttling back and forth from work. From what little I did get to see though, this place is beautiful. Between China&amp;rsquo;s belt and road initiative and the island&amp;rsquo;s oil money from the 90s, Infrastructure looked to be quite top notch. The airport terminal is quite spiffy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food was mediocre at best. The Magno hotel has a decent restaurant. Next time I&amp;rsquo;m here I should probably come over the weekend to explore the cafe&amp;rsquo;s and the boardwalk a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ~230 Ft towering Ceiba tree in the embassy compound is a terrific sight. Apparently this tree is quite prevalent all across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet in the hotel was barely functional - for call&amp;rsquo;s atleast. Looks like some port-blocking was definitely at play. Not having those daily calls back home maybe also made the trip feel a bit longer that it actually was? Need to go better prepared next time!

<p>Food was mediocre at best. The Magno hotel has a decent restaurant. Next time I&rsquo;m here I should probably come over the weekend to explore the cafe&rsquo;s and the boardwalk a bit.</p>
<p>The ~230 Ft towering Ceiba tree in the embassy compound is a terrific sight. Apparently this tree is quite prevalent all across Africa.</p>
<p>Internet in the hotel was barely functional - for call&rsquo;s atleast. Looks like some port-blocking was definitely at play. Not having those daily calls back home maybe also made the trip feel a bit longer that it actually was? Need to go better prepared next time!

&lt;p&gt;Go big or go home! Love this beautiful photo on top of the headboard in this room. Also, Hello Pickles! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/09/k-hotel/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
