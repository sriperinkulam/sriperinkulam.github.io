      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between M&amp;amp;S taking ill earlier this week and the shutdown/furlough drama on Wednesday, last week whizzed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined the Poth&amp;rsquo;s for a game night on Friday. S and the kids watched &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; while we played a bunch of games. Building your empire, Skyjoy, Really bad art, and that one real interesting game which we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to play&amp;hellip;2100 and had to get S to bed to be ready for the Swim meet next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnected with D. Konduru after almost 6 years. Time files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com//2021/10/07/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt; popped in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; today. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember posting about this but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I saved it in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&amp;rsquo;s down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/&#34;&gt;almost 10 year old&lt;/a&gt; hard drive before it goes kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicale.org/v3.html&#34;&gt;Radicale&lt;/a&gt; instance in my homeserver and configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davx5.com/&#34;&gt;DAVx5&lt;/a&gt; on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Furloughed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switched off my phone from airplane mode first thing this morning to check on the &amp;lsquo;Shutdown&amp;rsquo; status and as expected congress did fail to secure those 60 votes. Also received a couple emails mentioning my position was &lt;em&gt;non-excepted&lt;/em&gt; and hence I was effectively furloughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Received another email around 2200 stating my position is now considered &lt;em&gt;excepted&lt;/em&gt; and I need to report back to work the next working day. Alrighty, we&amp;rsquo;re back in business. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/01/furloughed/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Themocracy</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/29/themocracy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And just like that three-quarters of 2025 is in the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon is gearing for its Presidential elections. They go to polls on October 12th and it&amp;rsquo;s almost given that Paul Biya, who&amp;rsquo;s been in power since 1982, will be elected as the next president. He&amp;rsquo;s rocking it at 92 years. Of the 30 million populace only about 8 million are eligible to vote (20 years and older). Historically, these elections have been mired with civil unrest&amp;rsquo;s and protests. The next few weeks will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tomorrow night, if the Congress fails to  reach an agreement, we&amp;rsquo;re potentially looking at a shutdown. Beyond ridiculous that we seem to be at this juncture so frequently and living on continuing resolutions. This time around possibility of furloughs and RIFs [Reduction in Force] are highly likely. And then there&amp;rsquo;s also the drama that comes with it&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M most likely received her LNA invite. Yay! Looks like a training in December is a serious possibility. But again it&amp;rsquo;s never a given until she gets there and completes it. Adds a wrench to our planned December R&amp;amp;R and then a bigger wrench to how we handle bidding. 2026 is going to be beyond interesting. Choices, options, decisions and happy problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/29/themocracy/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

Baked my best ever whole-wheat vegan bread yet! This one was super straightforward and barely needed much pre-work. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/28/bread/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

Spent most of this morning building this RC fella. S received this &amp;rsquo;lego&amp;rsquo; kit as a gift for Christmas last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those frustrating yet terrific builds. Instructions were &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; and the parts were all mixed up. To compensate though, the build quality was terrific - the kind that gives you that satisfying &amp;lsquo;click&amp;rsquo; when you connect the pieces. Drives like a champ and the revolving gattling gun is a super neat addition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went out to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://apeactionafrica.org/mefou-primate-sanctuary&#34;&gt;Mefou Primate Santuary&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Just about 45 minutes from the city, this was an easy drive with pretty decent roads. Got to see a few chimps, spot monkeys and Gorillas. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome that they&amp;rsquo;re able to provide a terrific ecosystem for these primates to recover.  For as little as 35 GBP you could &lt;a href=&#34;https://apeactionafrica.org/sponsor-an-ape&#34;&gt;sponsor an ape&lt;/a&gt;!
