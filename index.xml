      <title>August Endings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just about winding down from the long weekend. Last week at work was super productive but also left me pretty drained by Friday. Working in a smaller shop comes with its perks but also brings in all the logistic hurdles. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing most of it is also got to do with us being in Africa. Travel logistics are a pain and the amount of admin overhead for getting actual stuff done is beyond bonkers. Decision memos, note-verbale&amp;rsquo;s, single entry visas, travel ticketing - always something that needs to be followed up on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family back in the states decided to rent a cabin in the Catskills and get some downtime. With photos coming in all weekend, definitely missed being there. Last time we did this in &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/09/04/poconos-fam/&#34;&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, it was a 50 odd group and we had such a good time overall. One of those moments when you feel this is the &lt;em&gt;tax&lt;/em&gt; you end up paying for choosing this career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exited a couple family WA groups that I&amp;rsquo;d joined in June/July to manage the air-ambulance for mummyjaan. Getting people off this wretched network is such a pain. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find a decent interim - use it where absolutely necessary and GTFO as soon as the work is done. Feels like I&amp;rsquo;m beating the same drum to a deaf audience but I will &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/01/16/lifting-the-veil/&#34;&gt;stand my ground&lt;/a&gt; on this shit. Currently I have the app installed in my &amp;lsquo;work profile&amp;rsquo; on my personal phone and turn it on only when really necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made some decent decisions on the financial front. With some liquidity, I think we now have a game-plan for some investments. Playing the long-game does seem to be making returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took some time this weekend to upgrade my Trilium instance to the &amp;lsquo;Next&amp;rsquo; version. Upgrade was painless. Major kudos to the new bunch of folks maintaining this real neat notes software. I do need to update a bunch of my notes here. Always an ongoing process!

      <title>Febe loop</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/31/febe-loop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite a &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;, but was some good time outdoors. Last night M suggested I head out for a run the next day since the weather has been really good - overcast and quite breezy. This morning though, the sky was super clear and it felt relatively hotter than usual. Decided to still head out and so glad I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides taking all the &amp;lsquo;offshoot&amp;rsquo; roads, I also ended up doing the whole loop. On the way downhill, besides a few stares here and there, it did feel decently safe. I did consciously get my earphones off though- just to be extra aware of my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feels good to be back on the roads after a couple months. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/31/febe-loop/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL Syncthing has an option to &amp;lsquo;ignore delete&amp;rsquo; in its advanced settings. Suepr neat! This simplifies posting images from the phone and lets me &amp;lsquo;declutter&amp;rsquo; the phone super fast. Likey, likey! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/21/ignore-delete/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;25 years ago, I was much into collecting stamps. Somewhere along the road that kinda stagnated. Moved over that digitized collection to this portal &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Malabo north paseo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazed at how well this &amp;lsquo;Paseo&amp;rsquo; is maintained! We were here in the morning on a weekend and there was barely anybody here. Word is also that this area is not really frequented by locals. Not even during the evenings. Wonder why though? This country&amp;rsquo;s got SO MUCH potential. The infrastructure is really good. Would be barely surprised if all of this is managed by a Chinese contracted firm. Definitely something to say about the merits of foreign influence.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/map&#34;&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; page to reflect posts that have a set location. Currently this is a super vanilla layout and I think I should cluster these by region. I do like how it&amp;rsquo;s turned out though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at it, I realised I missed downloading pictures from my old Flickr account to Nextcloud. Brought those in and nuked the Flickr account. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/03/maps/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup these three &lt;a href=&#34;https://meshtastic.org/&#34;&gt;meshtastic&lt;/a&gt; T1000-E radio&amp;rsquo;s today. Amazed at how tiny yet powerful these are. They seem to last for about three days with GPS and telemetry on. Until Meshtastic enables all the sensors I might probably box these up. In a pinch these can always be used for mesh&amp;rsquo;d comms if needed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/26/meshtastic/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
