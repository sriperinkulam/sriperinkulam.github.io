      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t figured where/when we want to retire yet, but sadly the U.S. seems to be a bleaker option with every passing day. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any country has really figured out their healthcare system well and those that had a decent stab at it seem to be hell bent on breaking it. For now, thankfully our Foreign service benefit plan does an okay job and we&amp;rsquo;re at an okay premium-benefit ratio. Only a question of time before that buckles though. As a former actuary, I do subscribe to the concept of having good insurance. However, the good ones are so few and stretched so thin. I keep telling my wife if we want to stay in the U.S. I should get back to teaching - Not just because I love it, but because it might also keep our premiums low in retirement. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/12/03/insurance/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the phone, I use Signal&amp;rsquo;s note-to-self to record on-the-go thoughts or to  quickly bookmark stuff. Later when on the laptop, I migrate these to my Trilium notes. After years of dabbling between multiple &amp;rsquo;notes&amp;rsquo; applications, this has stuck. Using the default messaging app as my notes &amp;lsquo;filter&amp;rsquo; definitely streamlined the process.

      <title>Mbankolo unlocked</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a failed attempt &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote/2025-nov-11/#note-1&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I made it up to Mbankolo this morning. Romero joined me and we ran into an LGF at the base of the hill. This place is pretty neat and way better than Mt. Febe! So glad I decided to give this another shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, instead of coming via the market, we decided to climb up towards Mt. Febe and took the inner roads via the golf course. This could be a fun route to retrace on the reverse sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to figure out why my garmin isn&amp;rsquo;t recording the GPX properly. Oddly, Looks like all other metrics are logged correctly. The only thing I really changed was syncing it with GadgetBridge last week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>250th Marine Ball</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a real good time at the Marine ball this year. This one felt way more &amp;lsquo;connected&amp;rsquo;. Probably because we knew almost everyone? Had to head back home around 2130 right around the time the music was kicking in. The souvenir &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/coin/#2025-msg-250th-marine-ball-coin&#34;&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt; looked pretty tame as compared to the coin the Yaoundé detachment designed earlier this year.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stopped by the Campost office earlier this Monday and bought a good ton of stamps. Added them to my digital &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp/#cameroon&#34;&gt;stamp collection&lt;/a&gt;. The Post office received a fresh coat of paint last month for the Presidential election. Staff were super welcoming and were super curious as to why we were purchasing that many stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s barely anybody I know that collects stamps still. Someday maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll mail these out to someone who&amp;rsquo;s genuinely interested.

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does it feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing the same story multiple times over the last three days? Because, maybe I actually did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote something to that effect earlier today to one of the teams I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to resolve an ongoing issue with. They are a good bunch of folks. But there seems to be a disconnect somewhere that&amp;rsquo;s causing needless delays in what I&amp;rsquo;d like to get done. I feel issues fail to get resolved mostly because of lack of proper communication during their shift handovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes after I sent that note, somewhere it also hit me real hard. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really have sent that note? It does not benefit anybody but just my restless self. Adds nothing positive to the situation and if anything effectively brings the relationship a few steps backwards. Super frustrating when you see both sides of the coin and still need to get shit done&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/11/14/handover/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
