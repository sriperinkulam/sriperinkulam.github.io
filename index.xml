      <title>Malabo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back from a work trip in Malabo. Got there last Thursday and worked through the weekend. We completed a minor site upgrade and completed almost all of the planned work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to explore any of the island since we were mostly shuttling back and forth from work. From what little I did get to see though, this place is beautiful. Between China&amp;rsquo;s belt and road initiative and the island&amp;rsquo;s oil money from the 90s, Infrastructure looked to be quite top notch. The airport terminal is quite spiffy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food was mediocre at best. The Magno hotel has a decent restaurant. Next time I&amp;rsquo;m here I should probably come over the weekend to explore the cafe&amp;rsquo;s and the boardwalk a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ~230 Ft towering Ceiba tree in the embassy compound is a terrific sight. Apparently this tree is quite prevalent all across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet in the hotel was barely functional - for call&amp;rsquo;s atleast. Looks like some port-blocking was definitely at play. Not having those daily calls back home maybe also made the trip feel a bit longer that it actually was? Need to go better prepared next time!

&lt;p&gt;Go big or go home! Love this beautiful photo on top of the headboard in this room. Also, Hello Pickles! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/09/k-hotel/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotted right in the same building as the Douala Embassy Branch Office. These folks are goddamn everywhere! There&amp;rsquo;s so little I knew about this firm back in 2015. Three good years doing some real fun work, but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I walked out that April 1st ! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/06/wtw/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Pinocchio</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/pinocchio.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

S wanted me to read Pinocchio out to her this afternoon. Later this night, right after she brushed her teeth, she innocently asked me if &amp;lsquo;wishing stars&amp;rsquo; were true. I of course, confirmed they did exist and that she had to patiently wait for the magic to come through. Now girl, not everything you read in books is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long she&amp;rsquo;ll actually believe these things but I do hope to keep this awesome concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/12/26/magic/&#34;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; alive in her as much as I can.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/04/pinocchio/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a good run with wireguard over the last four years, I switched over the devices on my home network to Tailscale today to lean-in on its mesh abilities. Technically I could have modified my wireguard setup to be a mesh network. But I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to tweak each configuration file!

&lt;p&gt;Home for the next two years! We just got here last night. Arrivals at the airport was super chaos. We do know what not to do next time though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city per se feels like a tier two city in India. Looks like we came in just in time for the short-rainy season. Walk to work is literally two minutes! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/04/16/yaounde/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked out of REI super thrilled that I&amp;rsquo;d got a fantastic pair of hiking boots for 32 dollars , only to realize that we&amp;rsquo;d been given a parking violation ticket of 100 dollars. In a rush to finish shopping here and head over to meet the Burke&amp;rsquo;s, we totally misread these signs. You win some, you lose lots!
