      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reorganized my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/07/migrating-over-to-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;Trilium Notes&lt;/a&gt; a bit. Over time I started dumping notes in there and somewhere it all went a bit wayward. I really need to start using it as a proper knowledge base. The good thing is &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; content that I refer to frequently is all in there. This along with my Signal &amp;lsquo;Note-to-self&amp;rsquo; are my go-to spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to read more blogs that are not tech related. Mostly driven by my curiosity in the tech space, I&amp;rsquo;ve somehow gotten into this bubble of tech-adjacent blogs. Would be nice to pop out a bit. Maybe I should explore &lt;a href=&#34;https://powrss.com/&#34;&gt;powRSS&lt;/a&gt; a bit? I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed I lean towards people who have their own personal domain. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of some sort of commitment towards actually owning their writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking if I want to get a nice digital sketch book. Or I should just re-purpose that old kindle? There are times I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to &amp;lsquo;write&amp;rsquo;. Some things are probably better just sketched out. I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.secuso.privacyfriendlysketching/&#34;&gt;Sketches&lt;/a&gt;
app before. Maybe i&amp;rsquo;ll just port that over to the kindle one of these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google seems to be making all moves to prevent sideloading apps in Android. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time I shift gears and look at other alternatives out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zen-browser.app/&#34;&gt;Zen browser&lt;/a&gt; looks real neat. Should give it a spin one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a mildly thawed frozen Papaya&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/29/all-over-the-place/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the primary draw in Webmentions for me is the &amp;lsquo;context&amp;rsquo; it provides. Several years down the lane when your &amp;lsquo;rewind&amp;rsquo; brings up a post, the value that provides is quite amplified when you are able to see what/when it was written for. Totally appreciate the &amp;rsquo;nudge&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;connection&amp;rsquo; factor too. After all, the inter-web exists because of people and connections we bring in. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/27/webmentions/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic, @hund@fosstodon.org ! Thanks for the nudge! I did try Gadgetbridge a few years ago. They didn&amp;rsquo;t quite support Garmin then. Gave it a spin just now and looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way! So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been exporting my garmin to my site but nothing like a full fledged app with all the bells and whistles. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/gadget-bridge/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immich is pretty neat! It does hog /need a decent machine to run though. I briefly dabbled  installing it on an RPi3 a year ago and figured the juice wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the squeeze for what I was looking at. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty content with having all my media on a Nextcloud server where rest of my files reside. This seven year old repurposed laptop on which NC runs In tandem with Tailscale and a digital frame, serves most of my needs for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also love that subtle clink you have going on in the comment form! Pretty crafty! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/immich/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week in Malabo, I discovered that none of my self-hosted services were working. Initially, I thought it was due to my home internet connection. However, upon returning last night, I realized that wasnâ€™t the case at all. My tiny reverse proxy, Caddy, had encountered an issue during an automated security upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve adopted a hands-off approach to self-hosting, setting up auto-updates for all my services. I only intervene when something breaks. Today, I decided to give my setup a little TLC, upgrading my passthrough VPS and Odroid XU4 to Bookworm. Remarkably, the process took less than 30 minutes! Thanks to Docker and Tailscale, everything connects seamlessly and just works. Love it! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/caddy-not-caddying/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL certain watches &amp;lsquo;skip seconds&amp;rsquo; to conserve battery and to indicate that they are almost out of charge. Noticed this in my Fossil watch a few weeks ago and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother finding out why. Today, it went dead and only then did I connect the dots! Super neat! Skip a second, warn but still keep time. This is similar to a vehicle&amp;rsquo;s indicator light flashing quicker when the bulb&amp;rsquo;s blown. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/25/skipping-seconds/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s friday night and Magno has their regular DJ blasting music downstairs by the restaurant. My room is right above the restaurant and there&amp;rsquo;s zero sound proofing. I plug my earphones in and turn on the noise cancellation. Works just as it is supposed to.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long few days. I&amp;rsquo;ll maybe listen to a podcast and fall asleep. Maybe read some?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sifting through my blogroll I land on &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/68fe2d14911b63.94312147&#34;&gt;Every mother visits but mine&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://azan-n.com/library/&#34;&gt;Azan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pineappleexpressmusic.bandcamp.com/track/find-you&#34;&gt;Finding you&lt;/a&gt; starts playing from my playlist. And from nowhere all memories of amma flash in my mind. Tears well up my eyes. I hold them back and pause the music. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help though. The post and the music maybe triggered those emotions? Or was it me thinking about her earlier this week during Diwali? Memories flash forward and backward like an old photo reel. I read somewhere memories are fickle. Each time you recollect something, it&amp;rsquo;s a variant of the actual. Your mind alters the recall very so finely that over time, your recall and what actually happened are way different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want that to happen. Memories are all I have of her.  And I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have any pictures of just her and me. I want to remember things the way they were at that moment. This is probably why I write about these fleeting moments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your close ones pass away, you don&amp;rsquo;t really miss them that very moment. You miss them at random moments and it whacks you real hard every single time. You&amp;rsquo;d think over time it&amp;rsquo;ll pass. But it fucking never does. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/24/missing/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
