      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic, @hund@fosstodon.org ! Thanks for the nudge! I did try Gadgetbridge a few years ago. They didn&amp;rsquo;t quite support Garmin then. Gave it a spin just now and looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way! So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been exporting my garmin to my site but nothing like a full fledged app with all the bells and whistles. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/gadget-bridge/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week in Malabo, I discovered that none of my self-hosted services were working. Initially, I thought it was due to my home internet connection. However, upon returning last night, I realized that wasnâ€™t the case at all. My tiny reverse proxy, Caddy, had encountered an issue during an automated security upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve adopted a hands-off approach to self-hosting, setting up auto-updates for all my services. I only intervene when something breaks. Today, I decided to give my setup a little TLC, upgrading my passthrough VPS and Odroid XU4 to Bookworm. Remarkably, the process took less than 30 minutes! Thanks to Docker and Tailscale, everything connects seamlessly and just works. Love it! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/caddy-not-caddying/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL certain watches &amp;lsquo;skip seconds&amp;rsquo; to conserve battery and to indicate that they are almost out of charge. Noticed this in my Fossil watch a few weeks ago and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother finding out why. Today, it went dead and only then did I connect the dots! Super neat! Skip a second, warn but still keep time. This is similar to a vehicle&amp;rsquo;s indicator light flashing quicker when the bulb&amp;rsquo;s blown. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/25/skipping-seconds/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s friday night and Magno has their regular DJ blasting music downstairs by the restaurant. My room is right above the restaurant and there&amp;rsquo;s zero sound proofing. I plug my earphones in and turn on the noise cancellation. Works just as it is supposed to.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long few days. I&amp;rsquo;ll maybe listen to a podcast and fall asleep. Maybe read some?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sifting through my blogroll I land on &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/68fe2d14911b63.94312147&#34;&gt;Every mother visits but mine&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://azan-n.com/library/&#34;&gt;Azan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pineappleexpressmusic.bandcamp.com/track/find-you&#34;&gt;Finding you&lt;/a&gt; starts playing from my playlist. And from nowhere all memories of amma flash in my mind. Tears well up my eyes. I hold them back and pause the music. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help though. The post and the music maybe triggered those emotions? Or was it me thinking about her earlier this week during Diwali? Memories flash forward and backward like an old photo reel. I read somewhere memories are fickle. Each time you recollect something, it&amp;rsquo;s a variant of the actual. Your mind alters the recall very so finely that over time, your recall and what actually happened are way different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want that to happen. Memories are all I have of her.  And I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have any pictures of just her and me. I want to remember things the way they were at that moment. This is probably why I write about these fleeting moments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your close ones pass away, you don&amp;rsquo;t really miss them that very moment. You miss them at random moments and it whacks you real hard every single time. You&amp;rsquo;d think over time it&amp;rsquo;ll pass. But it fucking never does. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/24/missing/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally got around adding an &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/about&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page on this site. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it took my twenty years for this! Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks into the shutdown and neither party seems to be in a rush to sort this out. Thankfully we have decent savings. Also does help that the state department has always paid two weeks late. This paycheck should be about 70% my regular paycheck accounting for work done until Sep 30th. There&amp;rsquo;s talk of this shutdown maybe making it to Thanksgiving. Historically, they&amp;rsquo;ve responded when ATC / TSA folks threw in their towels&amp;hellip;This time around might be different though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M wants to go to London with S. Thinking we should be able to absorb that cost. And then there&amp;rsquo;s the Virginia trip. Might be a pricey end of the year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the work front, looks like that Malabo trip is gonna happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon had its elections last sunday and Issa Tchiroma unilaterally declared victory today. Something that the Constitutional Council said would be considered &amp;lsquo;High treason&amp;rsquo;. They made it so far with very little unrest. Next few weeks though portends to be interesting! The worlds&amp;rsquo; oldest and longest serving president might not be all so benevolent after all.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/14/travel-and-drama/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my list of â€˜things to sortâ€™ is a bunch of files and physical documents that we&amp;rsquo;re compelled to move from place to place as we relocate every few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering getting a document scanner to digest these files digitally and get rid of them. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind for a few years now and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve reached that decision threshold to bite the bullet and get a scanner. Now these devices run anywhere between 200 and 600 USD that I am NOT interested in spending for this indulgence. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely hunt for one on ebay or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.backmarket.com/&#34;&gt;backmarket&lt;/a&gt; sticking to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/uses&#34;&gt;recycled hardware whenever feasible&lt;/a&gt; stand. The &lt;em&gt;Fujitsu Fi 6130&lt;/em&gt; seems to fit that &amp;lsquo;cheap and best&amp;rsquo;  bucket if sourced second hand. They seem to be selling for about 70 USD.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between M&amp;amp;S taking ill earlier this week and the shutdown/furlough drama on Wednesday, last week whizzed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined the Poth&amp;rsquo;s for a game night on Friday. S and the kids watched &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; while we played a bunch of games. Building your empire, Skyjoy, Really bad art, and that one real interesting game which we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to play&amp;hellip;2100 and had to get S to bed to be ready for the Swim meet next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnected with D. Konduru after almost 6 years. Time files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com//2021/10/07/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt; popped in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; today. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember posting about this but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I saved it in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&amp;rsquo;s down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/&#34;&gt;almost 10 year old&lt;/a&gt; hard drive before it goes kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicale.org/v3.html&#34;&gt;Radicale&lt;/a&gt; instance in my homeserver and configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davx5.com/&#34;&gt;DAVx5&lt;/a&gt; on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy!
