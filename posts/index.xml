      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a failed attempt &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote/2025-nov-11/#note-1&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I made it up to Mbankolo this morning. Romero joined me and we ran into an LGF at the base of the hill. This place is pretty neat and way better than Mt. Febe! So glad I decided to give this another shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, instead of coming via the market, we decided to climb up towards Mt. Febe and took the inner roads via the golf course. This could be a fun route to retrace on the reverse sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to figure out why my garmin isn&amp;rsquo;t recording the GPX properly. Oddly, Looks like all other metrics are logged correctly. The only thing I really changed was syncing it with GadgetBridge last week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a real good time at the Marine ball this year. This one felt way more &amp;lsquo;connected&amp;rsquo;. Probably because we knew almost everyone? Had to head back home around 2130 right around the time the music was kicking in. The souvenir &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/coin/#2025-msg-250th-marine-ball-coin&#34;&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt; looked pretty tame as compared to the coin the Yaoundé detachment designed earlier this year.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stopped by the Campost office earlier this Monday and bought a good ton of stamps. Added them to my digital &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp/#cameroon&#34;&gt;stamp collection&lt;/a&gt;. The Post office received a fresh coat of paint last month for the Presidential election. Staff were super welcoming and were super curious as to why we were purchasing that many stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s barely anybody I know that collects stamps still. Someday maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll mail these out to someone who&amp;rsquo;s genuinely interested.

&lt;p&gt;Why does it feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing the same story multiple times over the last three days? Because, maybe I actually did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote something to that effect earlier today to one of the teams I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to resolve an ongoing issue with. They are a good bunch of folks. But there seems to be a disconnect somewhere that&amp;rsquo;s causing needless delays in what I&amp;rsquo;d like to get done. I feel issues fail to get resolved mostly because of lack of proper communication during their shift handovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes after I sent that note, somewhere it also hit me real hard. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really have sent that note? It does not benefit anybody but just my restless self. Adds nothing positive to the situation and if anything effectively brings the relationship a few steps backwards. Super frustrating when you see both sides of the coin and still need to get shit done&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/11/14/handover/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because power, greed and corruption blindsided us and we got complacent with short term profits?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reorganized my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/07/migrating-over-to-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;Trilium Notes&lt;/a&gt; a bit. Over time I started dumping notes in there and somewhere it all went a bit wayward. I really need to start using it as a proper knowledge base. The good thing is &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; content that I refer to frequently is all in there. This along with my Signal &amp;lsquo;Note-to-self&amp;rsquo; are my go-to spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to read more blogs that are not tech related. Mostly driven by my curiosity in the tech space, I&amp;rsquo;ve somehow gotten into this bubble of tech-adjacent blogs. Would be nice to pop out a bit. Maybe I should explore &lt;a href=&#34;https://powrss.com/&#34;&gt;powRSS&lt;/a&gt; a bit? I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed I lean towards people who have their own personal domain. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of some sort of commitment towards actually owning their writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking if I want to get a nice digital sketch book. Or I should just re-purpose that old kindle? There are times I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to &amp;lsquo;write&amp;rsquo;. Some things are probably better just sketched out. I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.secuso.privacyfriendlysketching/&#34;&gt;Sketches&lt;/a&gt;
app before. Maybe i&amp;rsquo;ll just port that over to the kindle one of these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google seems to be making all moves to prevent sideloading apps in Android. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time I shift gears and look at other alternatives out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zen-browser.app/&#34;&gt;Zen browser&lt;/a&gt; looks real neat. Should give it a spin one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Google seems to be making all moves to prevent sideloading apps in Android. I think it&rsquo;s time I shift gears and look at other alternatives out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://zen-browser.app/">Zen browser</a> looks real neat. Should give it a spin one of these days.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the primary draw in Webmentions for me is the &amp;lsquo;context&amp;rsquo; it provides. Several years down the lane when your &amp;lsquo;rewind&amp;rsquo; brings up a post, the value that provides is quite amplified when you are able to see what/when it was written for. Totally appreciate the &amp;rsquo;nudge&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;connection&amp;rsquo; factor too. After all, the inter-web exists because of people and connections we bring in. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/27/webmentions/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic, @hund@fosstodon.org ! Thanks for the nudge! I did try Gadgetbridge a few years ago. They didn&amp;rsquo;t quite support Garmin then. Gave it a spin just now and looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way! So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been exporting my garmin to my site but nothing like a full fledged app with all the bells and whistles. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/gadget-bridge/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
