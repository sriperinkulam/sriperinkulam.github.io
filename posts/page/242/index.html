Was really tired and was in no mood to get back hanging in those RTC buses. I randomly stopped an auto and got into it. The driver had his son by his side. They were having muffled conversations and I just couldn’t help not listening. His wife was terminally ill and things were really getting worse. They didn’t have money to pay hospital bills and that’s the reason why he’s still driving people to their destinations just to earn some money to make ends meet. What was more touching was half way through the driver started singing songs loudly to cheer up the kid! It was probably a way of giving vent to his emotions. What else could he do!

All was fine but for the way the priest was reciting the mantras. I bet I could recite it better than him! It makes me think at times, how pathetic todays religious system in India is. Everything boils down to money! I very much know how important liquid cash is, but then one is at least supposed to do justice to what he’s doing. I’ve seen quite a few ceremonies happening at my own house . Years before, I remember pujas were performed in depth and at times lasted till the evening. But now it’s all done in a just an hour.The pujari gets a zillion calls amidst the ritual and he attends it with all pleasure handing over the reins to his secretary (I really don’t mind using that word).

I’ve got Ubuntu and Microsoft Xp installed on my system with dual boot configured. Still I haven’t logged into Windows for two weeks! The moment I’m in front of my desktop once I’m back from office, It’s Grub> modprobe> Ubuntu. I care a damn about windows now.
Last year connectivity and mouse issues held me up from shifting to Linux . Everything’s resolved now. Xp actually looks cheap dirt after two weeks of Ubuntu :-) .I’ve got Fiesty fawn for now and soon it’s gonna be Gutsy Gibbon! From a layman’s point of view, I’d say Fiesty is somewhere midway between XP and Vista. I’ve Heard exceptional reviews on Gutsy Gibbon. So i think it’s high time I say Good Bye to Windows!

It all started with Ridhimma calling at about 10:00 pm yesterday and telling she won’t be able to keep herself awake till 12! given the fact that she’s down with severe fever. So sweet of her to remember my birthday despite her illness! Rakesh up there from Houston pings me at about 12 in the night and wishes me. Poor chap is still cramming for some of his tests :-) ! Suysh pings just around the same time, wishes me and then threatens me for a party though she herself owes me one :-) ! Calvin all set to get screwed in his Generic Compre soon falls in tow. Later today, I get to know he’s done decently well! Good for him! :-)

With time the human brain gets so well accustomed to the intermittent loss of control that it fails to track those transitions. But the moment the transition is sensed you get so wary of the happenings, that you catch yourself doing things with extra care. Something that was mundane suddenly gets thrilling for no reason at all and at times you wonder why at all it’s happening in the first place!

It’s about an hours drive from my place and I tend to calculate how early or how late I am based on the relative presence or occurrence of other regular happenings around me. The bus gets to the outskirts by crossing a few posh areas in the city so it’s quite common to see International school buses drive past you. There’s this particular bus that I get to notice almost everyday about 100 yards from the Hitec city building. It’s not the bus that catches my attention. It’s a girl sitting by the third window in the bus.

I’d been to a place called Sangam a few weeks back when I was in Bang’lore. Next time you visit Bangalore,make it a point to visit this spot. It’s about 80 kms from the main city and believe me after having gone that far, you wont regret your decision! Sangam is in the Kanakapura district and is the confluence of the Cauvery River and the Arkavathi river in Karnataka. The river in its southward bound flow sqeezes down through a narrow gorge to reveal a breathtaking sight. The thundering sound of water and the sight of it gushing down in all might is something that I’d never forget! . This place where the river passes through the rocks is called the Mekhedatu. (The reason for it being called so still intrigues me. Mekhedaatu in kannada, literally translates to ‘Goat jump’ . Though the rocks were pretty close , A goat definitely couldn’t have jumped across the gorge. Anyways, names are names! :-) ) .

I’ve already seen the Malayalam and the Tamil versions of this film, so the movie wasn’t something that really interested me. What was more interesting is the way the Black ticket modus operandi that the theater management deploys.
They’re basically three types of tickets that are sold in this theater Rs30, Rs50 and Rs60. These are probably the rates which the Karnataka Goverment has set for medium rung theatres in the state ( I’m not a movie buff so I’m quite oblivious of the current rates :) ) . The show was at around 4:30 pm and we’d reached the theater well ahead of time at around 2:30 just to get the tickets. They were about fifteen people ahead of us in the queue and we were pretty sure we’d get the tickets this time. By the time we reached the counter, we were told that only four thirty rupees tickets were available and all other tickets were sold out. The hall as far as I know has no advanced booking facility and no internet booking. It is spacious enough to seat atleast 150 people and this guy here says he’s sold out all the tickets!! A few minutes later, the same guy comes out with a bunch of tickets in his hands , stands near the gate and starts selling the tickets for almost double the cost!!
