late, I take quite some time to read novels. How gripping it is really doesn’t matter. I finish a chapter or two and set it aside. Probably it’s just about rekindling that thrill to get back to it later for the next read ;-) !
I just finished reading a very old novel of John Grisham - The Rainmaker. One of his best writings, I would say. It’s about a law student by name Rudy Baylor fighting against a big time Insurance Company for it’s insensitiveness to one of its well deserving insuree. Just having passed the bar, this is one of his first few cases. To make things worse, Great Benefit - the insurance firm deploys a reputed lawyer to fight for them. Things get murky as days pass, making him wonder if at all he did the right choice in running up with the case. Amidst all this, he happens to meet a female Kelly , who’s tortured by her husband, in a hospital where he’s scouting for more cases. This is where the rafu chakkar starts :-) ! After a long tedious trial, he finally manages to win the suit for his client in a flamboyant manner but the irony is that the parent company of Great Benefit manages to wash it’s hands off leading to Great Benefit’s bankruptcy. Neither Baylor nor his client get what they’re legally bound to. Vexed with how things turned out he leaves Memphis and Law for good with Kelly!

So if you are into trekking and stuff and stay somewhere near bangalore it’s high time you enroll yourself in this group. They arrange treks in and around Bangalore almost every weekend. Even if you haven’t really been on a trek and are pretty much a novice, you can still enroll yourself. Each trek outing is classified as Beginners, Intermediate and the like and I believe they’ve got gears for beginners too.

“Veteran Congress leader and Khairtabad MLA, Mr P. Janardhan Reddy, died of a massive cardiac arrest here on Friday. He was 59 and leaves behind his wife, Sulochana, four daughters and a son. The funeral will be conducted with State honours at Amberpet on Saturday. A mass leader, Janardhan Reddy held sway over city politics for nearly three decades. His sudden death was a shock to the people of the city.

But today, two minutes into the install I realized where I was faltering. I’d created four partitions on my Hard disk of 30 Gigs each for Windows. Fiesty was running on the remaining 40Gigs. Last week during the installation I’d configured the setup to create a Primary ext3 partition instead of making it a logical one.That was what was leading the setup to freeze! Surprisingly I was never warned during the initial stages. Anyways, I fortunately happened to notice the goof up this time and then the rest of the Installation was a breeze! Flat 10 minutes and I had Gutsy live and kicking! :-)

I still remember that wonderful essay I’d written as a test to gain admission to Sandeepam Vidhyalaya! I was reminded of this episode today during my French class session. We were asked to write a short composition using a couple of basic sentences on some famous personality and even before I could pool in the Je’s, Il’s, fait’s, suis et al, my thoughts started drifting back to that particular day 10 years back.

Was really tired and was in no mood to get back hanging in those RTC buses. I randomly stopped an auto and got into it. The driver had his son by his side. They were having muffled conversations and I just couldn’t help not listening. His wife was terminally ill and things were really getting worse. They didn’t have money to pay hospital bills and that’s the reason why he’s still driving people to their destinations just to earn some money to make ends meet. What was more touching was half way through the driver started singing songs loudly to cheer up the kid! It was probably a way of giving vent to his emotions. What else could he do!

All was fine but for the way the priest was reciting the mantras. I bet I could recite it better than him! It makes me think at times, how pathetic todays religious system in India is. Everything boils down to money! I very much know how important liquid cash is, but then one is at least supposed to do justice to what he’s doing. I’ve seen quite a few ceremonies happening at my own house . Years before, I remember pujas were performed in depth and at times lasted till the evening. But now it’s all done in a just an hour.The pujari gets a zillion calls amidst the ritual and he attends it with all pleasure handing over the reins to his secretary (I really don’t mind using that word).

I’ve got Ubuntu and Microsoft Xp installed on my system with dual boot configured. Still I haven’t logged into Windows for two weeks! The moment I’m in front of my desktop once I’m back from office, It’s Grub> modprobe> Ubuntu. I care a damn about windows now.
Last year connectivity and mouse issues held me up from shifting to Linux . Everything’s resolved now. Xp actually looks cheap dirt after two weeks of Ubuntu :-) .I’ve got Fiesty fawn for now and soon it’s gonna be Gutsy Gibbon! From a layman’s point of view, I’d say Fiesty is somewhere midway between XP and Vista. I’ve Heard exceptional reviews on Gutsy Gibbon. So i think it’s high time I say Good Bye to Windows!

It all started with Ridhimma calling at about 10:00 pm yesterday and telling she won’t be able to keep herself awake till 12! given the fact that she’s down with severe fever. So sweet of her to remember my birthday despite her illness! Rakesh up there from Houston pings me at about 12 in the night and wishes me. Poor chap is still cramming for some of his tests :-) ! Suysh pings just around the same time, wishes me and then threatens me for a party though she herself owes me one :-) ! Calvin all set to get screwed in his Generic Compre soon falls in tow. Later today, I get to know he’s done decently well! Good for him! :-)
