class=entry-hint-parent>Pico de Águila Sur</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>I wanted to get some miles and alts in before we head to Orizaba next weekend. Decided on climbing Pico de Aguila since it’s just an hour from home. Hit the road around 0700 towards Ajusco. Since we didn’t quite have a working toll pass, Google maps took us through some inner roads. Boy, what a ride it was! Had we not had a local bus meandering ahead of us, I’m pretty sure, I would have chosen a different route. Having tope’s on a 80 gradient uphill didn’t help either. Just thankful we made it safely to the trailhead around 0830.

For the last few months, I relied on ISSO, but it kinda felt a bit too heavy. Finally scratched the itch and switched over to a basic form and some javascript to push comments over to my self-hosted ntfy server. For now, I’ve left the moderation to manual mode - I have to copy over the comments manually from NTFY to a comments.json file. A GO script that usually publishes this site also builds the comments for each of the posts as needed based on the posts’ permalink. Pretty friction-less and nifty! 🔗 ...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-02-05 21:30:00 -0500 -0500'>February 5, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;1 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;106 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;SSP</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Implementing static comments" href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/05/implementing-static-comments/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Boba Stickers</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Santa is so magical.

This would be my last TDY while here in Mexico City. We went in body-heavy and it did pay-off. A good bunch of cables were pulled and cameras fixed. The weather was impeccable. With gusty winds, super dark and bearing clouds and temperatures barely hitting the 50s - It was perfect outdoor work weather. More so high up on an extended ladder!

Earlier this morning Adam, Jacob and I head out from the cabin around 0150 towards the Malinche trailhead. M checked with some of the locals in town last evening and they mentioned most guided hikes start around 0200 to get to the peak in time for sunrise. We decided to go without a guide since the trail was straightforward and I was reasonably optimistic I could guide the group myself.

For a moment I assumed it was from the Seismic City alert system that CDMX has. Turned out, it was from the old blue dell laptop that I currently use to run NextcloudPi. For some reason, looks like it rebooted and went into a huge panic mode because it lost time sync. Yanked all the cables and shut it down.

Oh boy, what a trip this has been in terms of travel snafus! On our way there we got routed to San Antonio and got grounded for a couple hours because of inclement weather en-route.
On the way back, we thought we missed our connection in Dallas because of a delayed departure from Houston, and re-booked for a later flight from Dallas. However, our connecting flight was delayed too and when I checked at the counter in Dallas if we could get switched back to our previous booking, the attendant said that wouldn’t be possible. M however was adamant and worked her magic. Looks like they had a ‘weight restriction’ on the flight and M was able to convince them to flip back our reservations since we didn’t have anything to check-in.

M took a salsa making class and she said she loved it! A quick whirlwind trip to NJ, NY, MD for Rohita’s wedding. S went for a weeklong school trip to Pipiol.
