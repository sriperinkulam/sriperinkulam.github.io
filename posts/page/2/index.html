Quick work trip to Monterrey. Loved that those hills are right there in the city! Next time Iâ€™m back here, I should plan to get here around a weekend. Food was great. Traffic was meh. Would strongly consider bidding for a position here - if/when one opens up! M,S & S went to Oaxaca. They loved it! FEB Work travels took me to Merida and Managua. Managua had the vibes of any second tier southern Indian city. Antonâ€™s Whiskey tasting was uber fun! Girl scouts hike to Desierto Leones. Mike led the group. Was good to take a step back and be just a regular participant! Piedra Herrada Monarch butterfly trip. Barely got to spot any Monarchs. Looks like they made their way up north a bit sooner this year. MAR Aparna and Vuday visit us for a few days. Joined them on the hot air balloon up the Teotihuacan Pyramids. Such a cool experience! Back in Managua for a longish trip. Those wire pulls were painful but so much fun! M & S went to Las Estacas for the Girl Scouts Camping trip. Missed being there with them. We took our R&amp;R in Maui for about a week. So much fun being in the water! But boy, oh so pricey! Haleakala was neat. Missed the whales though! APR Hallucinations up on the Izta were surreal. Family visited Cancun. We took a rain-check. Just didnâ€™t make financial sense. Jothi patti and the Wiererâ€™s visited us for a week. The Nevado de toluca hike would probably be one of the highlights of our Mexico posting! Hiked up Pico de aguila cerro cruz. The descent was - oh so painful - but super fun! Work trip to Hermosillo. MAY Yet another epic Bourbon tasting evening. M took a salsa making class and she said she loved it! A quick whirlwind trip to NJ, NY, MD for Rohitaâ€™s wedding. S went for a weeklong school trip to Pipiol. Weâ€™d see the effects of it over the next few weeksâ€¦ Managed to fit in a NextcloudPi migration and setup the Digital Frame. Work took me back to Monterrey for a short project and then to Merida for a routine visit. Good bunch of travel this month. JUN Appa, Manni and Miss Bama whip out a super successful India trip. M,S and I went to a Blue Man Group performance. Jinesh & Soony visit us in CDMX for a few days. Tinkered a bit with Tasmota and HomeAssistant to setup a few smart-plugs.

Absolutely floored by the Schlitterbahn. M takes a PLP trip to Hidalgo. Yet another work trip to Merida. AUG A&amp;A move in to their new house! Work travel to Hermosillo for the NCC move. Super productive but tiring couple weeks. M&amp;S come visit me in HMO over one of the weekends. Wiererâ€™s visit CDMX for another short visit. Daphneâ€™s and WhiteBagleyâ€™s visit us for a few weeks. We make it to Nevado de Toluca for a short hike. SEP Hermosillo trip continues. M goes to Vancouver for the girlsâ€™ trip.

This time to Cascada de Burbuja I take the bike out for the Dia de muerto bike ride Elizabeth visits for a week. Diwali! M&amp;S visit Reino animal We do a short road trip to Tula and Tepozotlan Back to Matamoros for a long standing project. A mild cartel scare. Wordpress goes kaput. Migrated this portal to Hugo after dabbling around a bit. NOV Back to Merida for a prep trip. M,S & I head to Bacalar. Some good time in the Yucatan peninsula. Brought out some ESC colleagues to Nevado de Toluca S celebrates her 6th with a unicorn Pinata. DEC M finally hears about her CA-AEFM position V&amp;D visit us for a week. The Merida cores trip goes great! Visit Guadalajara for Carlosâ€™ wedding Houston visit was riddled with travel issues. Fun nevertheless!

Just not comfortable driving the GV until we get it properly serviced. Thankfully, we got a flight last minute and we head straight to the GDL zoo after landing. S has been wanting to see the penguins there for quite sometime now and what better opportunity than this?
The zoo was immaculately maintained! And with the Sky-cables and trains, this was such a great experience. We checked in at the AC hotel for some short down time and then head to an Arabic restaurant for some pretty delicious wraps because we were quite certain M wouldnâ€™t find anything vegetarian at the wedding. The wedding per se was super intimate with about 30 guests. I am glad we were able to fit this in despite a pretty packed end of the year. We head back to the hotel around 1145 just about when S was nearing her Iâ€™m done limit.

With the 24th declared a holiday, M suggested we go glamping in Estacas for a night. S loved the idea and we booked two tents for the five of us. Cost was super reasonable given it included breakfast and entry to the park.
We only got to Estacas around 1400 on 24th evening thanks to the four hours we lost to the brake fade on the Grand Vitara. After a quick check-in, we decide to rent a kayak and row down the stream. I hop off the kayak and swim upstream. S was bent on going to the kids pool alone and not getting into the spring. After about an hour, S & I head to the kids pool. She spends maybe 30 mins in there and calls it a day. Her only ask was that we have dinner by the spring, which we gladly agree to since thatâ€™s the only restaurant that was open. After dinner, S was sleepy but still super excited about spending the night in the tent. Happy kid, Happy camper! She sleeps through the night despite all the Christmas fireworks.

Been a while that Iâ€™ve surprised her! Twelve years ago when I gifted her the Kindle she was initially super upset - we barely had any money then. This time around when she opened it, her reaction was neutral at best.
Setting it up wasnâ€™t quite intuitive.Â Took me 20 minutes to figure out that the software wasnâ€™t showing the option for overdrive sync because it sensed our location to be outside US/Canada. An easy fix until we hit the next issue - M only has a Libby account and that does not map 1:1 to an Overdrive account. Looks like Iâ€™ll have to setup an overdrive accountÂ now, add all her library cards and then sync that account in the Kobo. Reasonable ask I guess. But doesnâ€™t really help my case of getting her to try off mainstream devices.

Definitely not at that moment though. Somewhere near Cuernavaca, The Grand Vitara had a brake fade 1 this morning on our way to Las Estacas. The brakes would just not work and it felt like I had to pump it to get even a bit of traction. Got super close to hitting the car in front of us but thankfully, I found a small lane (ditch?) to veer off from the traffic and engine braked it to a stop. Super lucky none of us were hurt and we were able to veer away from traffic just in time. Also lucky that this happened just about 100m from a mechanic shop! What are the odds? Took them about three hours to do a thorough check on all four wheels and fix the oil reservoir tray - which they broke while jacking the car up. Oh boy, what a start to this yearsâ€™ Christmas!

Overall, I think it went great. Most of the planning over the last few months paid off and but for a few minor issues, we were able top wrap up coring the NCC in about three days.
Also found a few fantastic food options through the week. For lunch we mostly had to do an Uber eats since there werenâ€™t many options around the new consulate. Habaneros was the find of the week though. Their Pimitos was on point!
