  <summary>Hike up was tiring! But we did save 3 minutes off the previous &amp;lsquo;run&amp;rsquo;. Romero was in form! I need to be able to run up this hill and feel good!
Spent rest of the morning in Carrefour and Spar, &amp;lsquo;paying it forward&amp;rsquo;.
Removed yet another friction point in &amp;lsquo;owning&amp;rsquo; my garmin data. Tweaked the garmin &amp;lsquo;plugin&amp;rsquo; to autofetch the gpx and summary json file names based on the date of the post. Now all I need to do is fetch the actual gpx and json files (Which is semi-automated by a tiny python script) and set the gpxfile:&amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; in my frontmatter to display a neat map of the workout and all the data.

  <summary>The Signal notifications annoyance continues - Turns out that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it either. Looks like I had this specific group enabled for notifications in a &amp;lsquo;custom notifications profile&amp;rsquo;. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t help either that I&amp;rsquo;m looking for this, all groggy, woken up by one of those group calls at an ungodly hour.

  <summary>Irony of the written word - The people whose thoughts you would really like to read, rarely write. It&amp;rsquo;s not because they don&amp;rsquo;t want to, it&amp;rsquo;s that they believe nobody cares to read. And in that void, sheer excellence vanishes. Write wherever you can, whenever you can, however you can. And if not for somebody else, build that memory capsule for your future self.

<p>The <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2026/01/15/op/">mishap</a> investigation results were disclosed yesterday. It had nothing to do with the Transformer smoke-up earlier last month or the irregular city power. The Gen Tech(s) purportedly acknowledged disabling several safety mechanisms at G20 over the span of five months to avoid the nuisance of repeat breaker tripping. For some reason, I&rsquo;m having a very hard time believing this&hellip;But I guess that is the conclusion of the non-partisan group and I do have full trust in their capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, very disconcerting that the techs&rsquo; that showed up at my place for a similar issue suggested removing the RCD to avoid the frequent breaker trips. Ultimately their supervisor vetoed that out and they decided to break the ground where the city power enters the building. Was a similar situation at play at G20 and they decided to remove the RCD?</p>
<p>To help process this, I am going to lean heavily on the premise that these technicians need consistent ongoing trainings and that I need to question every fix that is done henceforth. Do not trust. Always verify. OP should not have had to pay for this complacence. NOBODY should have&hellip;And yet here we are.</p>
<p>I did not see this coming and it&rsquo;s made me very jittery all evening. Maybe I should just hit the bed and let this ride out.</p>

  <summary>Went for a short hike/run up Mfoundi. G. Michaud kept the tempo up and boy, was it tough today? Started off cool but that lasted barely for 10 minutes. This part of the hill was control-burned last week so the ash smell was still very much present. Initially wanted to do the twin peaks but decided against it and clocked around 5.5 miles. Should probably wait for the rainy season to get back here.

<p>Played a few rounds of Sushi Go with S. Kinda like this game! S is getting wind of strategy and playing the long game.</p>
<p>Tweaked my Garmin code a bit to hide/display data on the map. Would be neat if I could display it as a 3D map one of these days.</p>

  <summary>Struck me today that I only need to retain at-most seven years of tax returns. Time to digitize those and shred the remaining.
Wrote a small python script to generate yearly/monthly summaries for my garmin data. Somewhere during the wordpress-&amp;gt;Hugo migrations, this fell through the cracks. Also, updated the garmin page to display those summaries.

I don&amp;rsquo;t think I understand Christianity. Just as I don&amp;rsquo;t understand other religions. But there&amp;rsquo;s something to be acknowledged about how they spread it though. Music moves people and they use it real well.
M was looking at the 2027 Summer and winter bid list. Both projections look pretty good.

  <summary>Noticed the big refrigerator wasn&amp;rsquo;t working this morning. Didn&amp;rsquo;t read much into it and left a work request for FAC once I was at work. Ran into Oben and requested him to take a look. Looks like he sent somebody home and they paged back stating there was 380v in the receptacles. Got back home around 1200 and confirmed the spike in multiple outlets. This is getting fucking annoying now. The FAC team reached in a few minutes and did their inspections. Looks like two breakers servicing different outlets were getting fused somewhere. Oben and Isaac meticulously troubleshot and finally found that one of the breakers had failed and was delivering only 90v instead of 220v at the load. Now, this was on a different phase and was potentially leading to the 380v across the phase and neutral on multiple outlets. They shifted this breaker to a different spare breaker and to the same phase as the other load line. Should be back tomorrow AM for further troubleshooting. Thankfully, none of my personal devices were connected to these outlets. The refrigerator ohmed out fine and turned back on once the receptacle was fixed. The RCD on the distiller breaker seems to have taken a hit. This needs to be fixed once we figure out a few more anomalies in the wiring.

<p>While I was putting S to sleep she asked why folks were still looking at the &lsquo;big panel&rsquo; if electricity was all fixed - per what I&rsquo;d confirmed yesterday. Really hope we get to the bottom of whatever this is real soon. These FAC technicians are really good at their work but they are up against heavy system anomalies induced by the transformer burst last week. With OP&rsquo;s celebration of life event scheduled for Saturday and the &lsquo;card making&rsquo; event tomorrow, it&rsquo;s going to be a heavy weekend for the kids(and all of us)? And I don&rsquo;t think I am ready for it.</p>

The FAC technicians came in today and replaced our Residual Current Device [RCD] and the Main breaker. Looks like the voltage surge(s) last week most likely shot the RCD.

  <summary>Shifted my TSP fund allocation from 100%C to 50%/25%/25% CSI. The I fund completed their benchmark index change last year to a more diversified international portfolio. Might consider weighing in more on it based on how it performs this year.
Another shift that I need to make is invest in a Roth IRA. Still pretty undecided how much Roth I want to go. But it would be good to get that 5 year clock ticking.

<p>Made some rice and lentils for the Poths. Been a while that I&rsquo;ve cooked for a big group. I think I did underestimate the quantities a bit. The lentils turned out to be real good!</p>
<p>The breaker is still tripping around noon. Wonder if they&rsquo;re shifting the load around then. Voltage seemed okay but this still is very concerning&hellip;</p>
<p>Playing overcooked2 with S over the last few days. She&rsquo;s winning good. I&rsquo;m having fun watching her win.</p>
<p>Had to top-up the brake-fluid in the Suzuki. A bit concerning since I did that just <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote/2025-dec-09/">about a month ago</a>?</p>

All she said was - &amp;lsquo;I thought it was just a shock&amp;rsquo; and moved on to talk about Yoshi and legos. Somewhere, I feel she&amp;rsquo;s gotten numb to this idea of death. Or is this just her way of coping? I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the questions will come and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure If I&amp;rsquo;ll have the answers for her.

<p>Took her out for a swim in the emb pool. She biked a bit, swam a bit and then played some pickle-ball. Later in the day I played some Overcooked 2 with her. Got some mundane chores done and played some pumping musing on the soundbar. All through the day though, every few minutes, I&rsquo;m reminded of OP and his family. What a tragedy they&rsquo;ve got to endure for the rest of their lives. How does one help and where do you fit in? Or can you at all?</p>

  <summary>Heard one of my surge protectors pop this afternoon out of the blue. MDP wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me flip the breaker back on. Got one of the tech&amp;rsquo;s to come take a look. We had 380v b/w neutral and ground. Absolutely no-bueno. For now we&amp;rsquo;ve been switched onto the Generator.

  <summary>Migrated from Postale.io to Migadu. The straightforward way - Select all, junk, delete account. Starting with a fresh clean slate.
Earlier today around 1600, one of the transformers right across the street from the emb smoked up. And with that it also smoked a couple diesel containers. Thankfully the fire was contained and subsided within an hour.
The award ceremony was moved, and continued indoors. B wrote me up for a Meritorious Honor Award. While I&amp;rsquo;m thankful, I think it should have been for all four of us (including him).

S has a race scheduled for Feb 6. Pappaji wanted to take her out to the stadium for a &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; run. And she ran 400m so gracefully after all that drama. So good!

M dropped us at the airport. There&amp;rsquo;s now a direct rail link to Dulles from Ballston. The silver line takes about 30 minutes straight. Love it!
This vacation got done way faster than I&amp;rsquo;d like it to end. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that always the case? Though we were here for two whole weeks, I feel I barely got to spend any time with M.

  <summary>Left Daphne around 0520 for the roadtrip down to Florida. Took us a sweet 16 hours. Lots of construction happening on I-95 in NC. I drive MD-VA-SC-FL while M takes on NC and Georgia. M finds a Mod Pizza somewhere in Jacksonville and we finally reach the hotel around 0030 next day morning. Next time around we should probably split this over two days and stop and explore a bit more of the country.

<p>Earlier this morning, Right when I thought we were making good time; the Grand Vitara decided otherwise. The starter relay would click, but that&rsquo;s that! With a dead battery and no jump-starter, I make alternate plans for S&rsquo; school drop-off. Thankfully the Emb. garage foreman is able to help with a battery purchase and we&rsquo;re back rolling around 1030; short by around 100,000 CFA but with a &lsquo;brand-new&rsquo; local battery. I do some back of the envelope calculations and this battery was probably 2/2.5 years old and I didn&rsquo;t see any tell-tale signs of it dying? On the way home, it strikes me that S&amp;I had left the interior light on last Friday night and through the weekend&hellip;that would do it. I am SO READY to fly out this weekend!</p>

  <summary>Love this feature in GotoSocial where they give you a tiny box to jot down a private note about an account when you&amp;rsquo;re following folks. Kinda nice to keep track of what led you to follow a specific account. Wish more sites gave you that option. I don&amp;rsquo;t think Bsky does it&amp;hellip;
S asked today if we will continue to work in the embassy when this war ends. I ask her what war she&amp;rsquo;s talking about. She says - I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; and moves on to something else. Wonder what&amp;rsquo;s going on in her mind&amp;hellip;🤔

<p>Solo-parenting is actually fun but tiring! Times when I wish I had a bit more control on my schedule. Shouldn&rsquo;t really complain though, workplace has been really flexible.</p>
<p>Our Travel authorization got approved! Hopefully the ticket prices haven&rsquo;t shot up. So looking forward to the break and some freezing cold!</p>

Switched the router onto the UPS! Wonder why it took me so long. Enabled meshnet on the VPN.

  <summary>Happy Thanksgiving!
M signed us up for a fun TurkeyTrot run this morning. Three loops around the Lac Municipal. We dropped S at school and head straight to the lake. Pretty decent turnout and it was good getting out there and scouting a place we haven&amp;rsquo;t been to before. Some real good showers last night and early this morning made for some great running weather.
Head to a colleagues place for a short visit and brought S back from school. Decided against going to that coffee shop since home coffee is anyways way better and M wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really find anything there. Enjoyed some good downtime at home!

  <summary>The jaans&amp;rsquo; are planning on joining us in December! So glad Mummyjaan is feeling better and is ready to travel. I think getting that medevac insurance should do us good.
Took S out to the pool on her bike. She enjoyed the ride and is getting quite comfortable on downhills. She&amp;rsquo;s also enjoying the water a lot more!
Looks like a reboot of the watch fixed that GPS issue. Also great to know that the garmin does not really need location access to track most of the data!

  <summary> S celebrated her birthday today with 9 of her friends. In her words - &amp;lsquo;It was great until the end&amp;rsquo;, and I&amp;rsquo;d agree!
She was super involved through the whole process - Chose the theme, custom made all the invites, selectively chose whom she wanted for her party, decided what kinda cake she wanted, the activities, the food, the return gifts - the whole gamut.
She&amp;rsquo;d asked me to make muffin pizzas and that was my only contribution&amp;hellip;M ran the show as always! The water balloon fight was a pretty neat idea! So was the jungle safari themed sun-shades for the kids. M and Ms. Mickey baked a confetti cake with cream cheese frosting - which turned out to be terrific. M made the cashew sweet and I made some cutlets for C. Poth.

<p>Around 1815 we decided to play the &lsquo;Empire&rsquo; game. Parents started trickling in and with that the game kinda fell through. S wasn&rsquo;t happy with that and had her emotions flipped. Add to that her immense dislike to say goodbye&rsquo;s. A small meltdown and all was good. Overall we think she handled it all pretty well. She&rsquo;s growing fast and so are her demands to be involved in all the decision making. Pretty fair, I guess! <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote/2025-nov-22/" style="text-decoration: none !important;">🔗</a>

There&amp;rsquo;s been an uptick on the number of Green Mamba sightings. A colleague mentioned he spotted three on Thursday and then a neighbor a few more both in their house and outside in the compound.
Finally bought that Fujitsu Fi 6130. Hoping it makes it to post by mid December!
YesYouKan looks pretty neat.

Got a decent couple miles and made my way back via SuperU.

<p>M gave me a haircut. Turned out to be &lsquo;dodgy&rsquo;. Good thing is, it should all grow back soon.</p>
<p>Ran a few errands and went to Socrat for lunch. THE best veggie burger I&rsquo;ve had in a good long while! Loved the service and definitely going back here.</p>
<p>Had to rebuild my playlist and re-import my music into the thumb-drive that Navidrome feeds off of. Something obliterated that folder. A quick Rsync and all&rsquo;s good!</p>
<p>Kinda nice to have a mid work-week holiday!</p>

Also pretty impressed with how much spanish has stuck in my mind. Malabo is a spanish city and it felt like being back in Mexico. It&amp;rsquo;s like a switch turned on the moment I land. Yet to get to that comfort level in French. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m just talking about pleasantries..

  <summary> Mobile signal and internet is apparently down in Yaounde. The pot&amp;rsquo;s slowly boiling and the city is expected to be on a hightened state of alert on Monday and Tuesday. Issa seems to be playing his cards real well! Hoping this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mess up my travel!
Spent most of my work day doing some fun troubleshooting and long needed housekeeping. Tidying up a ton of cables and tangles. Having an extra set of hands would been quite useful.

Noticed a bunch of men wearing dresses made of what looked like tarpaulin. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that make them super hot and sweaty? That said, cameroonian attire mostly seems to be colorful, flashy and&amp;hellip;uncomfortable?

Miss being in a place that celebrates Diwali. As a kid this was one of those days when we would get that one pair of new clothes! Carefully stitched so it would last at least three years. Crackers, snacks, smoke, diyas, explosions&amp;hellip;i want it all. Dawn to dusk and deep into the night. This year though it all turned out so M&amp;amp;S are in London and I&amp;rsquo;m by myself in Douala. WTF does &amp;lsquo;Happy Diwali&amp;rsquo; even mean? Ugh!

RSO had scheduled a recovery drill this morning for the kids. I think it went pretty well. Loved how they explained the whole process to the kids and how they conducted the whole drill. S was a bit hesitant at first but said she was so underwhelmed by the whole thing. She and her school buddy apparently expected a lot more fake &amp;lsquo;smoke and fire&amp;rsquo;.

<p>Rest of the day was a super blur. A bunch of cleaning and sorting. Mummyjaan&rsquo;s admitted to the hospital. Looks like she developed diabetic ketoacidosis because she didn&rsquo;t take her insulin timely&hellip;because of an unrelated throat infection&hellip;</p>
<p>Made Pizza for S, which came our real well. Super close to MOD pizza style!</p>
<p>Finished watching Inspector Zhende. Oh boy, I so love marathi!</p>

Was pricey at 28,000 CFAR but that also included the beach access. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s kinda comparable to say visiting Crane beach and paying for parking during peak summer.
On the way back we drove around in the National Park. The Chinese company that has the contract to maintain this place has maintained this outstandingly well!

<p>S enjoyed a decent meal at the lounge in the airport. In B&rsquo;lore, we have a super quick transition to the baggage claim and hop on a BMTC heading to Jayanagar 4th. But for a few waterlogged stops, we get to Jayanagar 4th in about 2 hours. A LOT of traffic but smooth flowing. Ron mentions later this is likely due to the automated traffic control system across the city. We head to Cafe Amudham for dinner followed by Baskin&rsquo;Robins for icecream. Some of the best dosas I&rsquo;ve had in a while. Also black currant ice cream!!</p>
<p>Get to the hotel around 2300 and get some much deserved sleep. Last few days have been beyond hectic and exactly what I would like to avoid in trips henceforth.</p>

As I sit in the car, it looms on me what I&amp;rsquo;ve committed to. 7 hrs today and 7 hours back tomorrow in the car is going to be rough on S. Heck, I&amp;rsquo;m not psyched about this too.

<p>Plan&rsquo;s to head to ERN to see Padmagireesan mama. His health&rsquo;s been on a downward spiral for a few months now.</p>
<p>Mumma drops S at 0800 and Daphne folks head to Padmanabhaswamy temple for an early morning darshan. I sleep in. We leave TVM around 1200. As I sit in the car, it looms on me what I&rsquo;ve committed to. 7 hrs today and 7 hours back tomorrow in the car is going to be rough on S. Heck, I&rsquo;m not psyched about this too. But Mama was really excited about the trip and I didnt want to be the one saying no&hellip;</p>
<p>Around 1500 we hear mama has passed away. In my mind I&rsquo;m actually glad he did. He&rsquo;s been going through this for a while now and it was only a question of time&hellip;</p>
<p>We make it to ERN by around 2000. Not a bad drive. Just tiring. Kids love the hotel. Mamaji enjoys the Jeera rice and dal Fry. We head to Panampilly nagar after this. A bit surprised the close family was shocked..but I guess I&rsquo;m the last person to understand emotions&hellip;Also maybe loosing Amma pretty young has made me numb to death? It consumes you slowly memory by memory at moments you&rsquo;d least expect.RIP mammaji.</p>
<p>Back to the hotel around 2300 and try and get some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be a long day&hellip;</p>

  <summary>It&amp;rsquo;s been a super rough night. S has been stirring all night sweating loads. I&amp;rsquo;ve barely caught any sleep. Maybe the poor ventilation in the room upstairs or just the hot humid A&amp;rsquo;bad heat..We wake up around 0400 and get ready to leave for the 0755 flight to TVM. Suresh Anna drops us in the airport giving us a quick morning tour of A&amp;rsquo;bad. Next time around I&amp;rsquo;m only coming here during winter.

<p>It&rsquo;s been a super rough night. S has been stirring all night sweating loads. I&rsquo;ve barely caught any sleep.

Suresh Anna drops us in the airport giving us a quick morning tour of A&rsquo;bad.
Next time around I&rsquo;m only coming here during winter.</p>
<p>On arrival in TVM, we head straight to Lalit Mahal, right by the Padmanabhaswamy temple. Daphne folks checkin there and we head to Vijayam Periammai&rsquo;s house for some epic lunch. Felt like a sadya! Raju Mama had come there. Boy, has he aged? So freaking disturbing to see him grow old all by himself. Not being there to take care of him will be one of my top regrets for a long time to come. Probably one of the biggest downsides of this career&hellip;</p>
<p>Mama and I take S to Shangumugam beach and then head home to Thanu Nagar. S wants to sleep with the kids in the hotel. We grab a quick dinner in Annapoorani and head back home. Doesn&rsquo;t take me long to get knocked out.</p>

They&amp;rsquo;d ordered a delicious cake for Nancy&amp;rsquo;s birthday.
Sweetu took us out to a Rajasthani dining experience. Food was okay. S didn&amp;rsquo;t quite eat much. Maybe the lack of sleep and the late nights are getting to her..

  <summary>Covered Golconda fort, Qutub Shahi tombs and Charminar before we head to AJ. Hot day out but most of them had a great time.
Golconda fort and Charminar were probably the highlight. Spent more than a couple hours in Golconda meandering through the various fort ruins. Six of us piled into one auto and made it to Qutib Shahi tombs. All of us had a good chuckle as Pattar held on to the rickshaw drivers hand instead of the support when he sat in front with the driver. &amp;ldquo;Arre, inno haath kaiko pakkadra miyan&amp;rdquo;.

All of us had a good chuckle as Pattar held on to the rickshaw drivers hand instead of the support when he sat in front with the driver. &ldquo;Arre, inno haath kaiko pakkadra miyan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Took two separate rickshaws from Qutub Shaving tombs to Charminar. Kids and daddy were definitely offput by the pollution and congested traffic as we neared Charminar. Daddy didn&rsquo;t want to come at first but some enticement with Irani chai did the trick. Took me a minute to figure out where Nimrah cafe was. With all the street side vendors you could barely spot it. This used to be one of my goto rides early in the morning!</p>
<p>Got two rickshaws to get out of the congestion and head to MGBS and took the metro from MGBS to habsiguda.Autorickshaw rides, streetside haggling, Metro rides, they got  it all.</p>
<p>AJ looks great thanks to the mega cleaning  they got done yesterday. Barely spent a couple hours here and head out for dinner.</p>
<p>Dinner was a disappointment. Basera no longer has Mehfil and the Uppu restaurant that&rsquo;s currently open there was a non-pleaser.</p>

  <summary>Nudged S awake and head to Vaishali&amp;rsquo;s for a quick morning breakfast with the Katamble&amp;rsquo;s.
S and I had some good downtime in Baner reading books. She loved the Elephant and Piggie omnibus book by Mo Willems&amp;hellip;Role reading was super fun.
Head to the airport around 1200. Uber was being super erratic but we did get to the airport just in time.
Ride to RKPuram took us about two hours. Most of this was in the city after we got to M&amp;rsquo;patnam.

Met my kids from my two years in TeachForIndia and Epiphany. So much fun! All in their 20s now and most are either doing a bachelors&amp;rsquo; or Masters. None of the girls are married and one is a TFI fellow in A&amp;rsquo;bad. So super proud of each one of them.

<p>Vivek and Sushant dropped us on their bikes in Shivaji Nagar at Ankur&rsquo;s place. His mom made some delicious lunch and we had some quick catchup  before we head to meet Bani&amp;Rupa in Kalyani Nagar. Had I planned this better, I would have swapped the last two. Going back and forth in this traffic was no bueno. Got back to Baner in time for the kids to have a few minutes together before they crashed for the day.</p>
<p>First day with S all by myself. She&rsquo;s such a trooper!</p>

  <summary>A decent run up Mount Febe today. Left a bit later than planned but had a really good run. Back home around 0850 just in time to head out to S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet.
She clocked her first ever gold for the assisted leg! Should be a good morale boost and hopefully get her to up her swim skills.
Back home took a good nap in the hammock for about 30 minutes. I could get used to a holiday like this! Run some decent distance, spend a good amount of time outdoors and then have some real good downtime.

The lady at the National Museum of Yaounde did an excellent job explaining the artifacts. I think she elevated our experience quite a bit.

Orange Money is super popular here. Using USSD codes, you can pay vendors once you&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;rsquo;topped up&amp;rsquo; your balance. One of our colleagues suggested we use WorldRemit to convert USD to Orange Money and that seems to work well so far.

This place looks and feels so much like Kampala. Maybe a bit less congested? Will get a better feel of this place once our car arrives here. Until then we&amp;rsquo;re at the mercy of our super helpful colleagues. And maybe motorpool.
Internet so far stinks! Not suprised, but I guess the reality is just sinking in. Will hopefully get a semi-permanent connection sorted out over the next week.

  <summary>Spent a couple hours with Gautam and fly early this afternoon and then met Ram at Ding Tai Fung for dinner. Food was great!
S mentioned she didn&amp;rsquo;t want me to plan climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro later this year. Ever since we watched Everest, she&amp;rsquo;s been super ancy about this. Will have to get her to talk to friends and family who&amp;rsquo;ve already summited this and see if that makes any difference&amp;hellip;

  <summary>S had a terrific time at &amp;lsquo;Flyover Vancouver&amp;rsquo;. Also jotted places I&amp;rsquo;d like to visit when I have the time.
After a delicious brunch at Tasty&amp;rsquo;s, we make our way back to Seattle for dinner with Sapan. Border crossing took us about 45minutes. Apparently the norm these days. Sapan mentioned how their plans to foster refugee kids was affected by the current policy changes. Interestingly, the next kid they were about to foster was from Cameroon&amp;hellip;

Met Zareen for dinner while they break their fast for Iftar. Tomorrow apparently would be the last day of fast.

Met Manju akka and fly for some delicious dinner! Nothing to beat some real good home cooked food!

Checkout from the hotel in Hurricane and decide to stop at the Valley of fire state park and Hoover dam on our way back to LV. The 50 mile scenic drive in the Lake Mead NRA was pretty cool.

  <summary>We head to the Lake Powell Marina for our boat tour first thing this morning. Just us and an old Chinese couple. The captain apparently does charter tours mostly and was filling in for somebody else. Over the couple hours he gives us a pretty good overview of Lake Powell and the Glen Canyon Dam. Amazed at the scale of the Colorado river - with a depth of around 400ft and about 250 miles long between the the Glen Canyon dam and the Hoover Dam. Note to self to watch DamNation.

<p>Grab a quick bite at Dari Thai and head to Canyon X for a slot canyon tour. The guide does a great job showing how these slot canyons are formed. S enjoys this way better than the boat tour.</p>
<p>From there we head back towards Hurricane stopping at Toadstool hoodoos for a short hike. Grab a quick bite at a small cafe and check-in to a hotel for the night.</p>

  <summary>Slightly side tracked by the Black rifle coffee, we leave around 0900 for the Glen Canyon National Recreational Area. In about four hours we get to the Glen canyon dam. M helps S with her junior ranger book while I stroll around the visitor center soaking in this majestic beauty.
We head straight to Horseshoe bend. About a 1.6 mile roudtrip hike from the parking lot. Both S &amp;amp; I feel the heat and the super crowded trail doesn&amp;rsquo;t help either. We grab a few photos and make our way back to the parking.

<p>Decide to check-in to hotel in Page and get some down-time before we head to Dari Thai Express for a quick &rsquo;night lunch&rsquo;. Delicious food! While at the visitor center, M noticed the Canyon boat tours brochure and was able to book us on a canyon tour for tomorrow. We decide to head over to the Wahweap Overlook and the Lone Rock beach for some night star gazing.</p>
<p>Beautiful night drive and I make a mental note to come back to this area next Home Leave. There&rsquo;s barely anything you can do with just a couple days and there&rsquo;s so much to explore and / or just do nothing.</p>

Spend a couple hours driving to and around Red Rock canyon National Recreation area.
Back in the new home we spend a few hours fixing the pool fence. Head out for dinner in an Italian diner. Delicious but overpriced food. Continue to be amazed by how ridiculously pricey dining out has become here in the states.

Back in the old house, we help with dismantling their furniture. Get the kids to bed and have a good time staying up late and savoring some Indian whiskey!

We swing by to their new home. Great time in the pool. From there we head out for dinner at #Hashtag after a short visit to the strip. As expected strip was &amp;lsquo;blah&amp;rsquo; with the regular shabang. Dinner was okay. Goli soda was probably the highlight.

Downloaded Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for S on the Switch. She&amp;rsquo;s taken a fascination for this and now&amp;rsquo;s probably a decent time to get her hooked onto the simple pleasures of gaming.
Tomorrow around this time, we would probably have handed the router over and be sans internet. Most of my self-hosted stuff - Nextcloud, Wallabag, Trilium notes, Miniflux etc will be down for a few weeks!

<p>Went to Pizzantastica for lunch! John joined us. Terrific pizza as always!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re no longer BCT136! Handed over the plates to GSO&hellip;and hoping the title makes it back to us soon&hellip;</p>

  <summary>Trying to implement something similar to DayOne. Essentially a place where I can dive in and jot quick notes for that day - not having to worry about frontmatter, templates etc.
I might have to do some minor tweaks on how images are displayed here similar to the photos page&amp;hellip;
M went over to the Jewish neighborhood in Centro Historico for the Post Language Program trip. S &amp;amp; I stayed back. Got some paperwork done for our visas. Walked over to El Jardín Escénico on Reforma and from there head over to Ehden Restaurant to meet the PLP group there. Some decent Lebanese food, a delicious date cake and a TERRIFIC arabic coffee!

  <summary>Tinkered a bit with my Matrix installation. Upgrade went smooth but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to backfill my messages in Element. Looks like the rooms get added back in only when some new message comes in. No biggie&amp;hellip;

  <summary>The packers came in today and boxed up most of our belongings. We&amp;rsquo;d already sorted stuff pretty decently, so they barely needed our intervention. Another team should come in tomorrow to load these out.
