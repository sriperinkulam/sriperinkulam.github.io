Hiked up the Ammonoosuc ravine trail that slowly winds up by the Ammonoosuc river.\nWithin about an hour we were at the Gem pool.\nPretty much beyond this point, the trail gains considerable elevation and finally lands you on the AMC lakes of the clouds hut.\nSome points on this stretch were a bit tricky but nothing too demanding. Rain or fog would probably make this a bit challenging.\nWith the sun shining pretty bright and almost no winds all through, the climb was more of a mildly intense workout than anything else.\nThe summit is visible on the left as you climb up to the hut.\nA quick stop at the hut for some tailwind shots and sandwich pops and we hit the 1.4 mile Crawford path to summit Mt. Washington.\nA bold warning sign warns of the inclement weather up on the summit. However, today’s weather makes it a no-brainer to surge forward. The wobbly rocks make it a bit tricky. We reach the summit at around noon and spend about an hour up there.\nWith the weather being pretty good the Cog rail was flooding the peak with quite a few folks.We soon start making our descent.\nThe Gulfside trail which leads up to Mt. Jefferson (which we decide not to summit today) crosses the Cog rail line that goes all the way down to the Marshfield station.\nAs we descend we come across quite a few rail coaches that are sluggishly making their way up and down the line. Makes for a fun distraction as you try and find food placement on the stone riddled path.\nPretty soon we hit the Jewell trail which would eventually get us off the ‘ridge line’, back into the woods and finally down to the parking lot.\nWith infrequent stops we close out the loop at around 04:00pm. The Jewell trail ends across the parking lot, right off the Base Station road.\n9.5 miles in 8+ hours with an elevation gain of about 3500 ft. Not too bad. Given the weather conditions and our pace, I believe we could have easily covered both Mt. Monroe and Mt. Jefferson.
