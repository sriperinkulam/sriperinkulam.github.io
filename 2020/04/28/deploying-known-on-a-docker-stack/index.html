While I am sure they’re out there on the Docker hub repository, I was not able to easily find any images that met my specific needs [php extensions for gd, zip, pdo_mysql etc]. So I went ahead and setup my own repository on Docker Hub.\nSomething I learnt today was that a docker stack only accepts pre-built images. Which essentially means you cannot use the regular build command on the fly in your docker-compose file. A quick work-around to that is to build the image locally and then publish it to a public repository from where the stack can easily access it.\nCreate a dockerfile: sudo nano dockerfile Copy over contents from my dockerfile gist. Edit or update if you need any additional extensions. Do note that I am pulling a debian buster image here. An alpine image would be optimal but lets’ run with this for now. Build the image locally: docker build -t sriperinkulam/php-7.4.3-apache-buster-plus:latest . Edit the image and tag name as needed. If your gist file is defined correctly, the image should be ready in a few minutes. It took me a few iterations to get this working with all the extensions I needed and shouldn’t give you any errors during the build process.\nLogin to your Dockerhub repo: docker login Push your image over to your repository: docker push sriperinkulam/php-7.4.3-apache-buster-plus:latest Within a few minutes, your image should be available for easy fetch whenever needed! Setting up and deploying the Known install\nCreate a folder for the known installation: sudo mkdir known \u0026\u0026 cd known\nCopy over my ‘known.yml’ gist from here and paste into a known.yml file. sudo nano known.yml\nThis is where we use the image we built earlier! Make sure you update the passwords there-in.\nCreate an ‘app’ folder. This is where we will copy in the core known package. sudo mkdir app \u0026\u0026 cd app\nMarcus Povey does the heavy lifting of packaging the known install ‘unofficially’. Download his latest pre-packaged release from his portal.\nwget https://withknown.marcus-povey.co.uk/\nFinally unzip/untar the package.\nStep back into the main ‘known’ directory and deploy the stack that we defined in the known.yml file. cd ..\nDOMAIN=known.domain.org SCHEME=https docker stack deploy -c known.yml known\nAssuming you’ve already setup the traefik container, as mentioned in my Jitsi post, you should now have Known up and running. Navigate to the domain and you should see the warmup page.\nKey in the db credentials that you setup in the known.yml file.
