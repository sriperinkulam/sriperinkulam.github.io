Swam about 300m in open water this afternoon. Felt so freaking good! This would probably be the highlight of this trip! Colleagues took us over to Sofitel for lunch. Was pricey at 28,000 CFAR but that also included the beach access. I guess that&rsquo;s kinda comparable to say visiting Crane beach and paying for parking during peak summer.</p><p>On the way back we drove around in the National Park. The Chinese company that has the contract to maintain this place has maintained this outstandingly well!</p></ol></div></div><div class=post-content><a href=/2025/08/09/malabo-north-paseo/ class="is-photo no-indent">09 Aug 2025:</a><div class=image-container><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"><br><p>Amazed at how well this &lsquo;Paseo&rsquo; is maintained! We were here in the morning on a weekend and there was barely anybody here. Word is also that this area is not really frequented by locals. Not even during the evenings. Wonder why though? This country&rsquo;s got SO MUCH potential. The infrastructure is really good. Would be barely surprised if all of this is managed by a Chinese contracted firm.

Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. <a href=../../../../location/pune/>Visiting Pune</a> was most fulfilling. Didn&rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in <a href=../../../../location/hyderabad/>Hyderabad</a> but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in <a href=../../../../location/ahmedabad>Ahmedabad</a> but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to <a href=../../../../location/trivandrum>Trivandrum</a> to meet Raju Mama. Drive to <a href=../../../../location/ernakulam>Ernakulam</a> wasn&rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in <a href=../../../../location/bangalore>Bangalore</a> but the flying <a href=../../../../location/madras>Madras</a> trip was one last minute surprise.</p><p>While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!

To not be presence-aware of someone 24x7.</p><p>Until now, S had either been with both M and I or just M when I travel for work. I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to be with just S alone for a long stretch. Until last week. M&amp;I thought it might be a good idea for her to travel with me from Dubai. It felt like she matured all of a sudden during Mummyjaan&rsquo;s hospitalization. Maybe she sensed the stress all around her and adapted?</p><p>As S traveled with me, zipping across 6 cities, I felt I was constantly on the hook. How much buffer time do I need to get her ready? Did she use the bathroom before we head out? Did I keep a spare set of clothes with me? Will I find the food that she might like in the new place? If not, did I have enough snack options for her? Do I need to get her clothes washed in this city or the next? Which PJ set would she like tonight? How do I coax her to sleep despite all the flux around her? What am I forgetting?&mldr;</p><p>And to not do that, now that she isn&rsquo;t with me, It feels odd. And then, when it actually dawns that M&rsquo;s doing this more or less 24x7x365 - besides the gazillion other things she does; I think the least I can do is get involved a lot more.

Mumma calls to check if she should get S ready. Plan was to leave ERN by 0800 so we could make it in time for our 1735 flight from TVM.</p><p>Quick breakfast at the Travancore Court and we leave ERN around 0900. S slept through most of the ride and making barely a couple stops enroute we reached TVM by around 1515. Super smooth drive. Amazed at how well maintained and clean these roads are.</p><p>S enjoyed a decent meal at the lounge in the airport. In B&rsquo;lore, we have a super quick transition to the baggage claim and hop on a BMTC heading to Jayanagar 4th. But for a few waterlogged stops, we get to Jayanagar 4th in about 2 hours. A LOT of traffic but smooth flowing. Ron mentions later this is likely due to the automated traffic control system across the city. We head to Cafe Amudham for dinner followed by Baskin&rsquo;Robins for icecream. Some of the best dosas I&rsquo;ve had in a while. Also black currant ice cream!!</p><p>Get to the hotel around 2300 and get some much deserved sleep.

Maybe the poor ventilation in the room upstairs or just the hot humid A&rsquo;bad heat..We wake up around 0400 and get ready to leave for the 0755 flight to TVM. Suresh Anna drops us in the airport giving us a quick morning tour of A&rsquo;bad.
Next time around I&rsquo;m only coming here during winter.</p><p>On arrival in TVM, we head straight to Lalit Mahal, right by the Padmanabhaswamy temple. Daphne folks checkin there and we head to Vijayam Periammai&rsquo;s house for some epic lunch. Felt like a sadya! Raju Mama had come there. Boy, has he aged? So freaking disturbing to see him grow old all by himself. Not being there to take care of him will be one of my top regrets for a long time to come. Probably one of the biggest downsides of this career&mldr;</p><p>Mama and I take S to Shangumugam beach and then head home to Thanu Nagar. S wants to sleep with the kids in the hotel.

Hot day out but most of them had a great time.</p><p>Golconda fort and Charminar were probably the highlight. Spent more than a couple hours in Golconda meandering through the various fort ruins. Six of us piled into one auto and made it to Qutib Shahi tombs. All of us had a good chuckle as Pattar held on to the rickshaw drivers hand instead of the support when he sat in front with the driver. &ldquo;Arre, inno haath kaiko pakkadra miyan&rdquo;.</p><p>Took two separate rickshaws from Qutub Shaving tombs to Charminar. Kids and daddy were definitely offput by the pollution and congested traffic as we neared Charminar. Daddy didn&rsquo;t want to come at first but some enticement with Irani chai did the trick. Took me a minute to figure out where Nimrah cafe was. With all the street side vendors you could barely spot it.

For the last few months, I relied on <a href=https://github.com/isso-comments/isso/>ISSO</a>, but it kinda felt a bit too heavy. Finally scratched the itch and switched over to a basic form and some javascript to push comments over to my self-hosted ntfy server. For now, I&rsquo;ve left the moderation to manual mode - I have to copy over the comments manually from NTFY to a comments.json file. A GO script that usually publishes this site also builds the comments for each of the posts as needed based on the posts&rsquo; permalink.

However, our connecting flight was delayed too and when I checked at the counter in Dallas if we could get switched back to our previous booking, the attendant said that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. M however was adamant and worked her magic. Looks like they had a &lsquo;weight restriction&rsquo; on the flight and M was able to convince them to flip back our reservations since we didn&rsquo;t have anything to check-in.</p><p>The trip otherwise was pretty uneventful. Some good time with family, speckled with delicious home cooked food and some oh-so-okay outside food.

The wedding per se was super intimate with about 30 guests. I am glad we were able to fit this in despite a pretty packed end of the year.

After a quick check-in, we decide to rent a kayak and row down the stream. I hop off the kayak and swim upstream. S was bent on going to the kids pool alone and not getting into the spring. After about an hour, S & I head to the kids pool. She spends maybe 30 mins in there and calls it a day. Her only ask was that we have dinner by the spring, which we gladly agree to since that&rsquo;s the only restaurant that was open. After dinner, S was sleepy but still super excited about spending the night in the tent. Happy kid, Happy camper!

Definitely not at that moment though. Somewhere near Cuernavaca, The Grand Vitara had a brake fade <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> this morning on our way to Las Estacas. The brakes would just not work and it felt like I had to pump it to get even a bit of traction. Got super close to hitting the car in front of us but thankfully, I found a small lane (ditch?) to veer off from the traffic and engine braked it to a stop. Super lucky none of us were hurt and we were able to veer away from traffic just in time. Also lucky that this happened just about 100m from a mechanic shop! What are the odds? Took them about three hours to do a <del>thorough</del> check on all four wheels and fix the oil reservoir tray - which they broke while jacking the car up. Oh boy, what a start to this years&rsquo; Christmas!</p><p>Immediately after we were able to get the vehicle to a stop, M asked if it was the floor mat that was the culprit. Nope - I&rsquo;d removed them a few days after we bought this car. All thanks to another <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/>dreadful experience</a> several years ago in the Grand Cherokee.</p><p>Ignorance and oversight only make sense in hindsight. About fifteen minutes before this incident, I did notice the brakes feeling soft and remember thinking - that&rsquo;s odd the brakes worked just fine so far. Also maybe I didn&rsquo;t notice the smoke from the tires because we were driving through quasi dirt roads? All signs of the brakes giving in - had I known about brake fade then.
