Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. <a href=../../../../location/pune/>Visiting Pune</a> was most fulfilling. Didn&rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in <a href=../../../../location/hyderabad/>Hyderabad</a> but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in <a href=../../../../location/ahmedabad>Ahmedabad</a> but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to <a href=../../../../location/trivandrum>Trivandrum</a> to meet Raju Mama. Drive to <a href=../../../../location/ernakulam>Ernakulam</a> wasn&rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in <a href=../../../../location/bangalore>Bangalore</a> but the flying <a href=../../../../location/madras>Madras</a> trip was one last minute surprise.</p><p>While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!

To not be presence-aware of someone 24x7.</p><p>Until now, S had either been with both M and I or just M when I travel for work. I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to be with just S alone for a long stretch. Until last week. M&amp;I thought it might be a good idea for her to travel with me from Dubai. It felt like she matured all of a sudden during Mummyjaan&rsquo;s hospitalization. Maybe she sensed the stress all around her and adapted?</p><p>As S traveled with me, zipping across 6 cities, I felt I was constantly on the hook. How much buffer time do I need to get her ready? Did she use the bathroom before we head out? Did I keep a spare set of clothes with me? Will I find the food that she might like in the new place? If not, did I have enough snack options for her? Do I need to get her clothes washed in this city or the next? Which PJ set would she like tonight? How do I coax her to sleep despite all the flux around her? What am I forgetting?&mldr;</p><p>And to not do that, now that she isn&rsquo;t with me, It feels odd. And then, when it actually dawns that M&rsquo;s doing this more or less 24x7x365 - besides the gazillion other things she does; I think the least I can do is get involved a lot more.

Decided to head to Chennai to drop S and get back to B&rsquo;lore for my flight to YND. This trip has been meh over meh&mldr;So many last minute changes. Hopefully things settle down a bit over the next few days.</p><p>Overheard someone talking about actuarial modeling in the airport. Some good conversation and we left for our gates. Can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been 10 years since I went on that career path!</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/bangalore/ class="is-note no-indent">17 Jul 2025:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Decide to wake S up around 1000. She&rsquo;s definitely got some good sleep in. Ron picks us from the hotel and we head to a few breakfast joints for some more dosas and coffee.</p><p>A quick stop at his place and we then head to their office. Super glad to see them doing really well. Pretty sure none of this was easy. Both of them are constantly on calls keeping tabs on multiple things.</p><p>Met Tanishq, one of Ron&rsquo;s kids from TFI. She&rsquo;s now working in Frontlyne and soon to be the lead. So proud!</p><p>Head to Parsa&rsquo;s for some delicious Kashmiri lunch. Gulped multiple cups of the kawa. Beautiful seating and super laid back. A good long visit to the Himalayas is long overdue.</p><p>We head to the aquarium from here. S loved it! Was super small but really well maintained.</p><p>Called it a night after some great pav bhaji at Ron&rsquo;s place.</p><p>M seems to be coming down with something.

Mumma calls to check if she should get S ready. Plan was to leave ERN by 0800 so we could make it in time for our 1735 flight from TVM.</p><p>Quick breakfast at the Travancore Court and we leave ERN around 0900. S slept through most of the ride and making barely a couple stops enroute we reached TVM by around 1515. Super smooth drive. Amazed at how well maintained and clean these roads are.</p><p>S enjoyed a decent meal at the lounge in the airport. In B&rsquo;lore, we have a super quick transition to the baggage claim and hop on a BMTC heading to Jayanagar 4th. But for a few waterlogged stops, we get to Jayanagar 4th in about 2 hours. A LOT of traffic but smooth flowing. Ron mentions later this is likely due to the automated traffic control system across the city. We head to Cafe Amudham for dinner followed by Baskin&rsquo;Robins for icecream. Some of the best dosas I&rsquo;ve had in a while. Also black currant ice cream!!</p><p>Get to the hotel around 2300 and get some much deserved sleep. Last few days have been beyond hectic and exactly what I would like to avoid in trips henceforth.</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/tvm-ern/ class="is-note no-indent">15 Jul 2025:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Plan&rsquo;s to head to ERN to see Padmagireesan mama. His health&rsquo;s been on a downward spiral for a few months now.</p><p>Mumma drops S at 0800 and Daphne folks head to Padmanabhaswamy temple for an early morning darshan. I sleep in. We leave TVM around 1200. As I sit in the car, it looms on me what I&rsquo;ve committed to. 7 hrs today and 7 hours back tomorrow in the car is going to be rough on S. Heck, I&rsquo;m not psyched about this too. But Mama was really excited about the trip and I didnt want to be the one saying no&mldr;</p><p>Around 1500 we hear mama has passed away. In my mind I&rsquo;m actually glad he did. He&rsquo;s been going through this for a while now and it was only a question of time&mldr;</p><p>We make it to ERN by around 2000. Not a bad drive. Just tiring. Kids love the hotel. Mamaji enjoys the Jeera rice and dal Fry. We head to Panampilly nagar after this. A bit surprised the close family was shocked..but I guess I&rsquo;m the last person to understand emotions&mldr;Also maybe loosing Amma pretty young has made me numb to death? It consumes you slowly memory by memory at moments you&rsquo;d least expect.RIP mammaji.</p><p>Back to the hotel around 2300 and try and get some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be a long day&mldr;</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/abad-tvm/ class="is-note no-indent">14 Jul 2025:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>It&rsquo;s been a super rough night. S has been stirring all night sweating loads. I&rsquo;ve barely caught any sleep. Maybe the poor ventilation in the room upstairs or just the hot humid A&rsquo;bad heat..We wake up around 0400 and get ready to leave for the 0755 flight to TVM. Suresh Anna drops us in the airport giving us a quick morning tour of A&rsquo;bad.
Next time around I&rsquo;m only coming here during winter.</p><p>On arrival in TVM, we head straight to Lalit Mahal, right by the Padmanabhaswamy temple. Daphne folks checkin there and we head to Vijayam Periammai&rsquo;s house for some epic lunch. Felt like a sadya! Raju Mama had come there. Boy, has he aged? So freaking disturbing to see him grow old all by himself. Not being there to take care of him will be one of my top regrets for a long time to come. Probably one of the biggest downsides of this career&mldr;</p><p>Mama and I take S to Shangumugam beach and then head home to Thanu Nagar. S wants to sleep with the kids in the hotel. We grab a quick dinner in Annapoorani and head back home. Doesn&rsquo;t take me long to get knocked out.</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/hyd-abad/ class="is-note no-indent">13 Jul 2025:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Took the early morning 0820 to A&rsquo;bad. Suresh Anna and Ambu received us at the airport and we head straight to Ambu&rsquo;s place. Always such a pleasure to meet Chitthi and co. Appa needed a short nap after lunch. We head to Suresh Anna&rsquo;s place for the rest of the evening. They&rsquo;d ordered a delicious cake for Nancy&rsquo;s birthday.</p><p>Sweetu took us out to a Rajasthani dining experience. Food was okay. S didn&rsquo;t quite eat much. Maybe the lack of sleep and the late nights are getting to her..</p></div></div><div class=post-content><a href=/2025/07/12/qutub-shahi-tombs/ class="is-photo no-indent">12 Jul 2025:</a><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent center"><li><img src=/2025/07/12/qutub-shahi-tombs/images/qutubshahi.jpg alt></li></ol><div><p></p><p>Quiet.

Hot day out but most of them had a great time.</p><p>Golconda fort and Charminar were probably the highlight. Spent more than a couple hours in Golconda meandering through the various fort ruins. Six of us piled into one auto and made it to Qutib Shahi tombs. All of us had a good chuckle as Pattar held on to the rickshaw drivers hand instead of the support when he sat in front with the driver. &ldquo;Arre, inno haath kaiko pakkadra miyan&rdquo;.</p><p>Took two separate rickshaws from Qutub Shaving tombs to Charminar. Kids and daddy were definitely offput by the pollution and congested traffic as we neared Charminar. Daddy didn&rsquo;t want to come at first but some enticement with Irani chai did the trick. Took me a minute to figure out where Nimrah cafe was. With all the street side vendors you could barely spot it. This used to be one of my goto rides early in the morning!</p><p>Got two rickshaws to get out of the congestion and head to MGBS and took the metro from MGBS to habsiguda.Autorickshaw rides, streetside haggling, Metro rides, they got it all.</p><p>AJ looks great thanks to the mega cleaning they got done yesterday. Barely spent a couple hours here and head out for dinner.</p><p>Dinner was a disappointment. Basera no longer has Mehfil and the Uppu restaurant that&rsquo;s currently open there was a non-pleaser.</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/pune-hyd/ class="is-note no-indent">11 Jul 2025:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Nudged S awake and head to Vaishali&rsquo;s for a quick morning breakfast with the Katamble&rsquo;s.</p><p>S and I had some good downtime in Baner reading books. She loved the Elephant and Piggie omnibus book by Mo Willems&mldr;Role reading was super fun.</p><p>Head to the airport around 1200. Uber was being super erratic but we did get to the airport just in time.</p><p>Ride to RKPuram took us about two hours. Most of this was in the city after we got to M&rsquo;patnam.</p><p>Kinda zapped from all this travel but decided to take the Daphne folks out for dinner in E&rsquo;woke. Was a hit with everybody.</p><p>Planning on taking them for a short sight seeing trip around Hyderabad tomorrow.</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/pune/ class="is-note no-indent">10 Jul 2025:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Landed in Pune late last night and reached Baner around 0030. This is HOME! So many great memories rush in as we drive past some of the landmarks in this beautiful city.</p><p>Met my kids from my two years in TeachForIndia and Epiphany. So much fun! All in their 20s now and most are either doing a bachelors&rsquo; or Masters. None of the girls are married and one is a TFI fellow in A&rsquo;bad. So super proud of each one of them.</p><p>Vivek and Sushant dropped us on their bikes in Shivaji Nagar at Ankur&rsquo;s place. His mom made some delicious lunch and we had some quick catchup before we head to meet Bani&amp;Rupa in Kalyani Nagar. Had I planned this better, I would have swapped the last two. Going back and forth in this traffic was no bueno. Got back to Baner in time for the kids to have a few minutes together before they crashed for the day.</p><p>First day with S all by myself. She&rsquo;s such a trooper!</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/2025/06/26/10ured/ class="is-note no-indent">26 Jun 2025:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Got an official notification confirming that I was tenured a
month ago. Yay! Pleasantly surprised. This doesn&rsquo;t really mean much, I guess, under the current administration. The recent RIF plans don&rsquo;t quite bode well for domestic folks and rumor is that overseas positions are up next. Should have more clarity over the next few days. All I need though is just a few more weeks to clock in those three years and get the whole benefit of the TSP.

There&rsquo;s still no dearth of monsoon drama though. A warm and humid afternoon leads in to a breezy evening. In just a few moments, it feels like you&rsquo;ve been transported to a coastal town.

Between China&rsquo;s belt and road initiative and the island&rsquo;s oil money from the 90s, Infrastructure looked to be quite top notch. The airport terminal is quite spiffy.</p><p>Food was mediocre at best. The Magno hotel has a decent restaurant. Next time I&rsquo;m here I should probably come over the weekend to explore the cafe&rsquo;s and the boardwalk a bit.</p><p>The ~230 Ft towering Ceiba tree in the embassy compound is a terrific sight. Apparently this tree is quite prevalent all across Africa.</p><p>Internet in the hotel was barely functional - for call&rsquo;s atleast. Looks like some port-blocking was definitely at play. Not having those daily calls back home maybe also made the trip feel a bit longer that it actually was? Need to go better prepared next time!

With the 24th declared a holiday, M suggested we go glamping in Estacas for a night. S loved the idea and we booked two tents for the five of us. Cost was super reasonable given it included breakfast and entry to the park.</p><p></p><p>We only got to Estacas around 1400 on 24th evening thanks to the four hours we lost to the <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/>brake fade on the Grand Vitara</a>. After a quick check-in, we decide to rent a kayak and row down the stream. I hop off the kayak and swim upstream. S was bent on going to the kids pool alone and not getting into the spring. After about an hour, S & I head to the kids pool. She spends maybe 30 mins in there and calls it a day. Her only ask was that we have dinner by the spring, which we gladly agree to since that&rsquo;s the only restaurant that was open. After dinner, S was sleepy but still super excited about spending the night in the tent. Happy kid, Happy camper! She sleeps through the night despite all the Christmas fireworks.</p><p></p><p>We wake up to a super crisp and nippy 25th morning. V and I decide to snorkel/swim in the warm 23C spring water. We spot some sleeping turtles and a great many schools of fish feasting on their morning find. After a simple yet delicious breakfast we make our way back to CDMX. Probably one of our best stays in Estacas so far and I&rsquo;m so glad we decided to glamp! Though S didn&rsquo;t get into the spring, she absolutely enjoyed our trip. <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/las-estacas/ style=text-decoration:none!important>🔗</a></p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/2024/12/24/kobo-clara/ class="is-note no-indent">24 Dec 2024:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Ordered a Kobo Clara BW for M on a whim. Been a while that I&rsquo;ve surprised her! Twelve years ago when I gifted her the Kindle she was initially super upset - we barely had any money then. This time around when she opened it, her reaction was neutral at best.</p><p>Setting it up wasn&rsquo;t quite intuitive. Took me 20 minutes to figure out that the software wasn&rsquo;t showing the option for overdrive sync because it sensed our location to be outside US/Canada. An easy fix until we hit the next issue - M only has a Libby account and that does not map 1:1 to an Overdrive account. Looks like I&rsquo;ll have to setup an overdrive account now, add all her library cards and then sync that account in the Kobo. Reasonable ask I guess. But doesn&rsquo;t really help my case of getting her to try off mainstream devices.</p></div></div><div class=post-content><a href=/2024/12/24/brake-fade/ class="is-photo no-indent">24 Dec 2024:</a><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent center"><li><img src=/2024/12/24/brake-fade/images/GrandVitaraCuernavaca.jpg alt></li></ol><div><p></p><p>Downhill and no brakes, what fun! Definitely not at that moment though. Somewhere near Cuernavaca, The Grand Vitara had a brake fade <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> this morning on our way to Las Estacas. The brakes would just not work and it felt like I had to pump it to get even a bit of traction. Got super close to hitting the car in front of us but thankfully, I found a small lane (ditch?) to veer off from the traffic and engine braked it to a stop. Super lucky none of us were hurt and we were able to veer away from traffic just in time. Also lucky that this happened just about 100m from a mechanic shop! What are the odds? Took them about three hours to do a <del>thorough</del> check on all four wheels and fix the oil reservoir tray - which they broke while jacking the car up. Oh boy, what a start to this years&rsquo; Christmas!</p><p>Immediately after we were able to get the vehicle to a stop, M asked if it was the floor mat that was the culprit. Nope - I&rsquo;d removed them a few days after we bought this car. All thanks to another <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/>dreadful experience</a> several years ago in the Grand Cherokee.</p><p>Ignorance and oversight only make sense in hindsight. About fifteen minutes before this incident, I did notice the brakes feeling soft and remember thinking - that&rsquo;s odd the brakes worked just fine so far. Also maybe I didn&rsquo;t notice the smoke from the tires because we were driving through quasi dirt roads? All signs of the brakes giving in - had I known about brake fade then. Wee bit wiser now I guess? <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/ style=text-decoration:none!important>🔗</a></p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Apparently that is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_fade>technical term</a> for a failed brake.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/2024/12/20/merida/ class="is-note no-indent">20 Dec 2024:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Back from a productive work trip in Merida.

The syndication icon only shows up if a valid link is present in the FrontMatter of a post. Once micro.blog picks up the feed, it&rsquo;s currently set to auto publish to the fediverse on my GoToSocial (GTS) instance. On the backend, a GO script fetches the RSS feed from my GTS instance and saves the RSS feed item link and the corresponding link to my post in a JSON file. Another script quickly looks up which post&rsquo;s FrontMatter needs to be updated for the syndication links in each post and updates the files as needed. A bit windy but seems to do the job for now. I might end up consolidating these into just one script later and/or directly use the masto API to publish to the fediverse and grab the syndication link from there.

While straightforward, It felt redundant to share copies of the same pictures in multiple places. I’ve been looking for options to share album links instead that would give us a bit more control. All our photos are primarily saved in a Nextcloud self-hosted instance. I explored a few options of album shares there but wasn’t quite happy. Pixelfed was another option I explored. It did check most of the requirements but I wasn’t quite comfortable relying on a software that’s mostly dependent on just one developer. Also the unlisted feature on their albums seemed half-baked and not yet ready for prime-time. Finally played a bit with PhotoPrism and so far it seems to be something that checks all the boxes. With private links, a PWA app and great thumbnails this might be the closest solution for my photo needs.</p></div></div><div class=post-content><a href=/2024/06/09/jmp/ class="is-note no-indent">09 Jun 2024:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Been looking for a Google voice number replacement for sometime now and looks like I might have found one that meets most of my needs.

The upgrade seemed to go well until it threw a PHP error which got me going in circles. In hindsight, I&rsquo;d setup automatic upgrades on NextcloudPi and Nextcloud, which seems to have conflicted with the actual distribution&rsquo;s update.

Thankfully, on Sunday morning, S seemed to have almost recovered and I decide to head out to meet Mo at his place. With some starting troubles (literally!) we finally leave for Ajusco around 0830.</p><p>The drive up is super straightforward and we park at the trailhead around 1000. We decide to take on the steeper parts of the climb first going clockwise. Around 1200 we reach Pico de Águila (12596&rsquo;) and in another 30 minutes we summit Cerro La Cruz del Marquez (12871&rsquo;). The way down from the Cerro was super steep at an 82° gradient. So glad we decided not to climb up from here and note to self to bring a knee brace for these downhills next time I hike here in CDMX. The loose volcanic soil and incessant pebbles make for dicey path downhill. We finish the hike at around 1400 and relish some hot cakes at one of the shacks at the base.</p><p>More than anything, this hike was a major morale booster after last weeks Izta attempt.</p><hr><p>2024-04-14 09:43:52 - <strong>Pico de Águila et Cerro La Cruz del Marquez</strong> 🥾 Hiked 4.69 miles in 04:50:29 Pace : 61.94 min/mile.

That’s when a Zoroastrian woman living in Mumbai snuck up into the tower and found bloated, rotting bodies everywhere. The vultures were gone. And not just at the tower — all across the country.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In this episode, we follow the Kenyan bird biologist, Munir Virani, as he gets to the bottom of this.

Core CPU temperatures were hitting the 80s despite the system being on literally no load. When I first bought it in mid-2020, I was aware that this lineage of tiny monsters were known for their &lsquo;hot&rsquo;ness and the fan being a bit loud.  Only over the last few months have I really seen this sudden spike in temperatures though.</p><p>The first obvious step was to get rid of the plastic lid and get those aluminum heat-sinks. That helped a bit until yesterday when the temps shot to the 90s for no reason. A quick <strong>htop</strong> run didn&rsquo;t seem to show any processes that were hogging resources. Troubleshooting this a bit further, I figured I did run some apt updates a few days back that triggered Kernel updates. I might now have to get into the BIOS and see if any firmware updates are pending. As luck might have it though, the current keyboard that I have functions via Bluetooth only and I can&rsquo;t quite use it to get into the BIOS.

Humanity constantly evolves from a quagmire of possibilities and there&rsquo;s very little merit in looking in retrospect. I think the likelihood of a successful forecast can only be enhanced if we work with the factors in the <strong>present</strong> - not the past, not the future. The past is barely helpful and you&rsquo;d rather not rely on those from the future. (Odd I say that after all those years I spent churning numbers as an actuarial analyst.) Ultimately what trumps is that humans find it really hard to delineate emotions from decision making. As much as you&rsquo;d like to disagree, you see it in every realm - Medicine, Finance, Sports, Academics, Health just to name a few.</p><p>In 2016, we had a fascinating <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/>close call on I-15 S</a> while heading towards New Haven. (Fascinating because, I learnt it the hard way and everyone who drives a car and has a floor-mat should be aware of this.) Accidents tend to give you that moment for retrospect and back then I jotted something similar to the thoughts I have today:</p><blockquote><p>The proverbial – ‘Everything happens for a reason’ is just not true. I believe the human brain does a wonderful job in assigning a reason to the cause and quite conveniently this is always subtly and retrospectively done. In its quest to find reason, it ends up triggering neural connections that emotionally and logically seem reasonable. So when and how do we draw the line while making choices and how do you substantiate the choices you’ve made? Or is the whole premise that as a logical and emotional machine you’re feeding good and bad data (choices) as a stimulus to train the body to better react to unforeseeable situations in the future?</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve taken <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2010/01/21/gut-instinct-twitter-and-my-career/>quite</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/08/10/for-good-for-now/>some</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/11/23/weeknote-47-shastas-first/>risky</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/10/21/flight-down-south/>shifts</a> in my career over the last decade. Most driven by what I felt at that very moment - Gut instinct. Absolutely none that I regret. And most have been very rewarding. So when it comes to making a choice at that critical moment, I try and keep retrospectives at bay. Every once in a while, I do catch myself careening from this golden rule. That&rsquo;s when I take a good pause, stop connecting the dots and look at just that isolated dot at that moment. It&rsquo;s worked wonders before and I trust that streak to continue. Irony being, my previous statement moots everything I said before! What can I say, we&rsquo;re a good bunch of optimistic morons.</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/2022/01/31/the-more-that-i-read-and-the-more-that-i-build-wi/ class="is-note no-indent">31 Jan 2022:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>The more that I read and the more that I build, with every additional service that I self-host, I realize there are so many points of failure – each becoming more evident as time passes and experience grows.

The intent was to document his thoughts and perspectives of the years gone by and to get glimpses of his generation. We learnt so many interesting things about our family that we wouldn&rsquo;t have known if we hadn&rsquo;t done this. An oral history of sorts! This has been on the back burner for a while now and I&rsquo;m so glad we got this rolling! This along with the family tree project has sent me down the rabbit hole of documenting our ancestral history.</p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/2021/07/20/aint-no-1-typing-.-https--t.co-of1tc9j1mg/ class="is-note no-indent">20 Jul 2021:</a><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent center"><li><img src=/2021/07/20/aint-no-1-typing-.-https--t.co-of1tc9j1mg/images/1417462777778692098-E6vW4isWQAIcW5B.jpg alt></li></ol><div><p>Ain&rsquo;t no 1 typing &lsquo;. <a href=https://t.co/of1tc9J1mg>https://t.co/of1tc9J1mg</a></p><p></p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/user/status/1417462777778692098>Link to Tweet</a></p></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/2021/07/15/guacamole-clientless-remote-desktop-access-ht/ class="is-note no-indent">15 Jul 2021:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Guacamole – Clientless Remote Desktop access: <a href=https://t.co/bXZm1MRsGL>https://t.co/bXZm1MRsGL</a></p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/user/status/1415465128720470020>Link to Tweet</a></p></div></div><div class=post-content><a href=/2021/07/01/july-1-2021-0400/ class="is-note no-indent">01 Jul 2021:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>#TIL you don&rsquo;t quite have to give your email address (or it&rsquo;s alias) to subscribe to substack newsletters.

This was her first longish bike ride (~10 mi) and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Riding on the roads here in India calls for a totally different skill-set. If living in a city, you need to ride through traffic to get to the trail/viewpoint and more often than not other vehicles drive totally oblivious of your existence. Miss V weaved in and out while navigating the traffic signals and it was a pleasure seeing her learn the ropes from the corner of my eye. We&rsquo;re also using bikes that are 20+ years old! So she had to deal with skipping crank-sets and loose chains! I got them to a ride-able condition a few weeks back. However, bike maintenance is overdue and now&rsquo;s probably the best time to get her into that too.</p><p></p></div></div><div class=post-content><a href=/2021/04/18/april-18-2021-1640/ class="is-note no-indent">18 Apr 2021:</a><ol class="photo-list no-indent center"></ol><div><p>Whoa..That&rsquo;s awesome!

Incredible experience!#Firsts - Petted a Cheetah on her terms in a controlled wild environment. Followed the guide into the enclosure (the size of a football field) locking the door behind us. He alerted the two cheetahs, calling their names and slowly moved towards them. The two hid amidst the bushes. We approached them cautiously from one end to another. Probably the size of a football field. One continued playing while the other stretched out and lounged on the grass. The guide first approached and petted her and we followed suit. A few minutes later the guide asked us to walk out slowly - us first and he right behind us. Still inside the enclosure for about five to ten minutes, the guide continued answering our questions. The cats were minding their own business least worried about our presence. Eventually got out of the enclosure.Never fathomed I'd be this close to wild animals&mldr;Insane experience. Subconsciously I did regulate my breathing with some deep breaths now and then&mldr;Looking back, there was no plan B!#TIL Lions are the only cats that hunt in groups. The females hunt mostly for food. Males pitch in only when required and take care of the cubs when the females are out. Males get first dibs, followed by the cubs and only then the females get to eat. Alpha males become the leader of the pack. On some occasions, outcast lions tend to form a pack making them the strongest force in the forest. Quite similar to 'gangs' on the street. While hunting the alpha picks one particular prey and the rest in the pack get the cue and help corner it down. Rest of the non-chosen one's are NOT attacked even if they're an easy target. #Firsts - Fed a Giraffe and learnt they're mostly silent! Their hearts are pretty big and weight about 10Kilos#Firsts - Met the insanely wise looking Shoebill! This one socializes by nodding its head downwards and 'clapping' with its beak!#Firsts - Met about 20 chimps and realised how insanely similar they were to Humans. One little one was using a long twig to fetch bananas from the stream. Could easily pass off for a human kid. No kidding!#TIL about the Keystone Species! Reminded me about the Alabama Sturgeon and the introduction of wolves to save an ecosystem.</p><p><a href=https://vimeo.com/261381702#Kampala>https://vimeo.com/261381702#Kampala</a> #Uganda
