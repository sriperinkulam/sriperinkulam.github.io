Posts</h2><p>A summary of all the micro-posts that I might have syndicated elsewhere. Quite a bit of the functionality on this page might be broken.</p><hr><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/celebration-of-life/ class="is-note no-indent">24 Jan 2026:</a><div class=image-container><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent center"><br><p>The Poths had a beautiful &lsquo;Celebration of life&rsquo; event for OP. Spiritual, but beautiful.
Ecole de musique Arbre a musique performed exceptionally well. D Davilla was incredibly good too.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think I understand Christianity. Just as I don&rsquo;t understand other religions. But there&rsquo;s something to be acknowledged about how they spread it though. Music moves people and they use it real well.</p><p>M was looking at the 2027 Summer and winter bid list. Both projections look pretty good.</p><p>Watched &lsquo;Rescued by Ruby&rsquo; for S&rsquo; movie night.</p></ol></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/380-again/ class="is-note no-indent">22 Jan 2026:</a><div class=image-container><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent center"><br><p>Noticed the big refrigerator wasn&rsquo;t working this morning. Didn&rsquo;t read much into it and left a work request for FAC once I was at work. Ran into Oben and requested him to take a look. Looks like he sent somebody home and they paged back stating there was 380v in the receptacles. Got back home around 1200 and confirmed the spike in multiple outlets. This is getting fucking annoying now. The FAC team reached in a few minutes and did their inspections. Looks like two breakers servicing different outlets were getting fused somewhere. Oben and Isaac meticulously troubleshot and finally found that one of the breakers had failed and was delivering only 90v instead of 220v at the load. Now, this was on a different phase and was potentially leading to the 380v across the phase and neutral on multiple outlets. They shifted this breaker to a different spare breaker and to the same phase as the other load line. Should be back tomorrow AM for further troubleshooting. Thankfully, none of my personal devices were connected to these outlets. The refrigerator ohmed out fine and turned back on once the receptacle was fixed. The RCD on the distiller breaker seems to have taken a hit. This needs to be fixed once we figure out a few more anomalies in the wiring.</p><p>While I was putting S to sleep she asked why folks were still looking at the &lsquo;big panel&rsquo; if electricity was all fixed - per what I&rsquo;d confirmed yesterday. Really hope we get to the bottom of whatever this is real soon. These FAC technicians are really good at their work but they are up against heavy system anomalies induced by the transformer burst last week. With OP&rsquo;s celebration of life event scheduled for Saturday and the &lsquo;card making&rsquo; event tomorrow, it&rsquo;s going to be a heavy weekend for the kids(and all of us)? And I don&rsquo;t think I am ready for it.</p></ol></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/nostalgia-theory/ class="is-note no-indent">21 Jan 2026:</a><div class=image-container><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent center"><br><p>S asked if the electricity was safe now&mldr;I feel somewhere it hasn&rsquo;t hit her yet.

She was oddly non-chalant to it. All she said was - &lsquo;I thought it was just a shock&rsquo; and moved on to talk about Yoshi and legos. Somewhere, I feel she&rsquo;s gotten numb to this idea of death. Or is this just her way of coping? I&rsquo;m hoping the questions will come and I&rsquo;m not sure If I&rsquo;ll have the answers for her.</p><p>Took her out for a swim in the emb pool. She biked a bit, swam a bit and then played some pickle-ball. Later in the day I played some Overcooked 2 with her. Got some mundane chores done and played some pumping musing on the soundbar. All through the day though, every few minutes, I&rsquo;m reminded of OP and his family. What a tragedy they&rsquo;ve got to endure for the rest of their lives. How does one help and where do you fit in?

And with that it also smoked a couple diesel containers. Thankfully the fire was contained and subsided within an hour.</p><p>The award ceremony was moved, and continued indoors.

S has a race scheduled for Feb 6. Pappaji wanted to take her out to the stadium for a &lsquo;feel&rsquo; run. And she ran 400m so gracefully after all that drama.

S seems to be really keen on going skiing so we decided to head to Liberty. Mjaan and Daddy enjoyed some hot chocolate at the Chalet while M,S, Miss V and I head to the slopes. S had some good runs and decided she wanted to head back in. Miss V and I ran a few more runs. Great day on the slopes. Took us quite some time to get going because of meager staff at the resort.

MD DMV license renewal needs vision certification from a select group of certified optometrists though, which apparently costs an absurdly ridiculous price of 105 USD. What a freaking racket! I should have walked away. In fact, I briefly said I would. But I didn&rsquo;t. I NEED to say NO more and stick with it!</p><p>Took S to ClimbZone. She&rsquo;s sprinting to the top like a lizard!

Took us about an hour to get to the NSI airport.

Built a tiny posting interface to cross-post content from this site to elsewhere on-demand if needed.

Super proud of her staying the course and deciding to pursue it! Wouldn&rsquo;t say so for myself - for ahem - having slept through the online broadcast and barely logging in just before it ended. For the record though it&rsquo;s 2100 here and I fell asleep putting S to sleep&mldr;</p><p>Earlier this morning, Right when I thought we were making good time; the Grand Vitara decided otherwise. The starter relay would click, but that&rsquo;s that! With a dead battery and no jump-starter, I make alternate plans for S&rsquo; school drop-off. Thankfully the Emb. garage foreman is able to help with a battery purchase and we&rsquo;re back rolling around 1030; short by around 100,000 CFA but with a &lsquo;brand-new&rsquo; local battery. I do some back of the envelope calculations and this battery was probably 2/2.5 years old and I didn&rsquo;t see any tell-tale signs of it dying? On the way home, it strikes me that S&amp;I had left the interior light on last Friday night and through the weekend&mldr;that would do it. I am SO READY to fly out this weekend!</p></ol></div></div><div class="post-content border-post"><a href=/daynote/2025-dec-14/ class="is-note no-indent">14 Dec 2025:</a><div class=image-container><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent center"><br><p>This heat, routine and mundaneness is a bit jarring.

S celebrated her birthday today with 9 of her friends. In her words - &lsquo;It was great until the end&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;d agree!</p><p>She was super involved through the whole process - Chose the theme, custom made all the invites, selectively chose whom she wanted for her party, decided what kinda cake she wanted, the activities, the food, the return gifts - the whole gamut.</p><p>She&rsquo;d asked me to make muffin pizzas and that was my only contribution&mldr;M ran the show as always! The water balloon fight was a pretty neat idea! So was the jungle safari themed sun-shades for the kids. M and Ms. Mickey baked a confetti cake with cream cheese frosting - which turned out to be terrific. M made the cashew sweet and I made some cutlets for C. Poth.</p><p>Around 1815 we decided to play the &lsquo;Empire&rsquo; game. Parents started trickling in and with that the game kinda fell through. S wasn&rsquo;t happy with that and had her emotions flipped. Add to that her immense dislike to say goodbye&rsquo;s. A small meltdown and all was good. Overall we think she handled it all pretty well. She&rsquo;s growing fast and so are her demands to be involved in all the decision making.

Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. <a href=../../../../location/pune/>Visiting Pune</a> was most fulfilling. Didn&rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in <a href=../../../../location/hyderabad/>Hyderabad</a> but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in <a href=../../../../location/ahmedabad>Ahmedabad</a> but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to <a href=../../../../location/trivandrum>Trivandrum</a> to meet Raju Mama. Drive to <a href=../../../../location/ernakulam>Ernakulam</a> wasn&rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in <a href=../../../../location/bangalore>Bangalore</a> but the flying <a href=../../../../location/madras>Madras</a> trip was one last minute surprise.</p><p>While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!

To not be presence-aware of someone 24x7.</p><p>Until now, S had either been with both M and I or just M when I travel for work. I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to be with just S alone for a long stretch. Until last week. M&amp;I thought it might be a good idea for her to travel with me from Dubai. It felt like she matured all of a sudden during Mummyjaan&rsquo;s hospitalization. Maybe she sensed the stress all around her and adapted?</p><p>As S traveled with me, zipping across 6 cities, I felt I was constantly on the hook. How much buffer time do I need to get her ready? Did she use the bathroom before we head out? Did I keep a spare set of clothes with me? Will I find the food that she might like in the new place? If not, did I have enough snack options for her? Do I need to get her clothes washed in this city or the next? Which PJ set would she like tonight? How do I coax her to sleep despite all the flux around her? What am I forgetting?&mldr;</p><p>And to not do that, now that she isn&rsquo;t with me, It feels odd. And then, when it actually dawns that M&rsquo;s doing this more or less 24x7x365 - besides the gazillion other things she does; I think the least I can do is get involved a lot more.

S slept through most of the ride and making barely a couple stops enroute we reached TVM by around 1515. Super smooth drive. Amazed at how well maintained and clean these roads are.</p><p>S enjoyed a decent meal at the lounge in the airport. In B&rsquo;lore, we have a super quick transition to the baggage claim and hop on a BMTC heading to Jayanagar 4th. But for a few waterlogged stops, we get to Jayanagar 4th in about 2 hours. A LOT of traffic but smooth flowing. Ron mentions later this is likely due to the automated traffic control system across the city. We head to Cafe Amudham for dinner followed by Baskin&rsquo;Robins for icecream. Some of the best dosas I&rsquo;ve had in a while. Also black currant ice cream!!</p><p>Get to the hotel around 2300 and get some much deserved sleep.

So freaking disturbing to see him grow old all by himself. Not being there to take care of him will be one of my top regrets for a long time to come. Probably one of the biggest downsides of this career&mldr;</p><p>Mama and I take S to Shangumugam beach and then head home to Thanu Nagar. S wants to sleep with the kids in the hotel.
