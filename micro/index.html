For a moment I assumed it was from the Seismic City alert system that CDMX has. Turned out, it was from the old blue dell laptop that I currently use to run NextcloudPi. For some reason, looks like it rebooted and went into a huge panic mode because it lost time sync. Yanked all the cables and shut it down. Something to figure out over the next few days when I have time. <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/13/blue-dell-alert/ style=text-decoration:none!important>🔗</a></p></div></div><a href=/2025/01/10/clara/ class="is-reply no-indent"><u>10 Jan 2025</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list no-indent"></ol><div><p>/s This turned out to be simpler than I thought. All I had to do was add all the libraries to the overdriive account on the desktop. And then login to that overdrive account on the Kobo. By design, only one card shows on the Kobo. To borrow books from a library not shown on the Kobo, you&rsquo;ll have to fetch that on a separate device. So simple! <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/10/clara/ style=text-decoration:none!important>🔗</a></p></div></div><a href=/2025/01/05/houston-calling/ class="is-photo no-indent"><u>05 Jan 2025</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent"><li><img src=/2025/01/05/houston-calling/images/houston.jpg alt></li></ol><div><p>We wanted to make it to Houston during S&rsquo; Christmas break, because we very well knew we might not come here during our home leave. Oh boy, what a trip this has been in terms of travel snafus! On our way there we got routed to San Antonio and got grounded for a couple hours because of inclement weather en-route.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, we thought we missed our connection in Dallas because of a delayed departure from Houston, and re-booked for a later flight from Dallas. However, our connecting flight was delayed too and when I checked at the counter in Dallas if we could get switched back to our previous booking, the attendant said that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. M however was adamant and worked her magic. Looks like they had a &lsquo;weight restriction&rsquo; on the flight and M was able to convince them to flip back our reservations since we didn&rsquo;t have anything to check-in.</p><p>The trip otherwise was pretty uneventful. Some good time with family, speckled with delicious home cooked food and some oh-so-okay outside food. Also note-to-self to make these trips shorter to just about two nights instead of week-long.<a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/05/houston-calling/ style=text-decoration:none!important>🔗</a></p></div></div><a href=/2024/12/29/carlos-wedding/ class="is-photo no-indent"><u>29 Dec 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent"><li><img src=/2024/12/29/carlos-wedding/images/carlos_gdl.jpg alt></li></ol><div><p>We decided not to drive to GDL for Carlos&rsquo; wedding. Just not comfortable driving the GV until we get it properly serviced. Thankfully, we got a flight last minute and we head straight to the GDL zoo after landing. S has been wanting to see the penguins there for quite sometime now and what better opportunity than this?</p><p>The zoo was immaculately maintained! And with the Sky-cables and trains, this was such a great experience. We checked in at the AC hotel for some short down time and then head to an Arabic restaurant for some pretty delicious wraps because we were quite certain M wouldn&rsquo;t find anything vegetarian at the wedding. The wedding per se was super intimate with about 30 guests. I am glad we were able to fit this in despite a pretty packed end of the year. We head back to the hotel around 1145 just about when S was nearing her <em>I&rsquo;m done</em> limit.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, we head to the vegan restaurant that M had scouted for a quick breakfast and get to the GDL airport just in time for the flight back to CDMX.

With the 24th declared a holiday, M suggested we go glamping in Estacas for a night. S loved the idea and we booked two tents for the five of us. Cost was super reasonable given it included breakfast and entry to the park.</p><p></p><p>We only got to Estacas around 1400 on 24th evening thanks to the four hours we lost to the <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/>brake fade on the Grand Vitara</a>. After a quick check-in, we decide to rent a kayak and row down the stream. I hop off the kayak and swim upstream. S was bent on going to the kids pool alone and not getting into the spring. After about an hour, S & I head to the kids pool. She spends maybe 30 mins in there and calls it a day. Her only ask was that we have dinner by the spring, which we gladly agree to since that&rsquo;s the only restaurant that was open. After dinner, S was sleepy but still super excited about spending the night in the tent. Happy kid, Happy camper! She sleeps through the night despite all the Christmas fireworks.</p><p></p><p>We wake up to a super crisp and nippy 25th morning. V and I decide to snorkel/swim in the warm 23C spring water. We spot some sleeping turtles and a great many schools of fish feasting on their morning find. After a simple yet delicious breakfast we make our way back to CDMX. Probably one of our best stays in Estacas so far and I&rsquo;m so glad we decided to glamp! Though S didn&rsquo;t get into the spring, she absolutely enjoyed our trip. <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/las-estacas/ style=text-decoration:none!important>🔗</a></p></div></div><a href=/2024/12/24/kobo-clara/ class="is-note no-indent"><u>24 Dec 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list no-indent"></ol><div><p>Ordered a Kobo Clara BW for M on a whim. Been a while that I&rsquo;ve surprised her! Twelve years ago when I gifted her the Kindle she was initially super upset - we barely had any money then. This time around when she opened it, her reaction was neutral at best.</p><p>Setting it up wasn&rsquo;t quite intuitive. Took me 20 minutes to figure out that the software wasn&rsquo;t showing the option for overdrive sync because it sensed our location to be outside US/Canada. An easy fix until we hit the next issue - M only has a Libby account and that does not map 1:1 to an Overdrive account. Looks like I&rsquo;ll have to setup an overdrive account now, add all her library cards and then sync that account in the Kobo. Reasonable ask I guess. But doesn&rsquo;t really help my case of getting her to try off mainstream devices.</p></div></div><a href=/2024/12/24/brake-fade/ class="is-photo no-indent"><u>24 Dec 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list single-image no-indent"><li><img src=/2024/12/24/brake-fade/images/GrandVitaraCuernavaca.jpg alt></li></ol><div><p></p><p>Downhill and no brakes, what fun! Definitely not at that moment though. Somewhere near Cuernavaca, The Grand Vitara had a brake fade <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> this morning on our way to Las Estacas. The brakes would just not work and it felt like I had to pump it to get even a bit of traction. Got super close to hitting the car in front of us but thankfully, I found a small lane (ditch?) to veer off from the traffic and engine braked it to a stop. Super lucky none of us were hurt and we were able to veer away from traffic just in time. Also lucky that this happened just about 100m from a mechanic shop! What are the odds? Took them about three hours to do a <del>thorough</del> check on all four wheels and fix the oil reservoir tray - which they broke while jacking the car up. Oh boy, what a start to this years&rsquo; Christmas!</p><p>Immediately after we were able to get the vehicle to a stop, M asked if it was the floor mat that was the culprit. Nope - I&rsquo;d removed them a few days after we bought this car. All thanks to another <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/>dreadful experience</a> several years ago in the Grand Cherokee.</p><p>Ignorance and oversight only make sense in hindsight. About fifteen minutes before this incident, I did notice the brakes feeling soft and remember thinking - that&rsquo;s odd the brakes worked just fine so far. Also maybe I didn&rsquo;t notice the smoke from the tires because we were driving through quasi dirt roads? All signs of the brakes giving in - had I known about brake fade then. Wee bit wiser now I guess? <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/ style=text-decoration:none!important>🔗</a></p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Apparently that is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_fade>technical term</a> for a failed brake.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div></div><a href=/2024/12/20/merida/ class="is-note no-indent"><u>20 Dec 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list no-indent"></ol><div><p>Back from a productive work trip in Merida. Overall, I think it went great. Most of the planning over the last few months paid off and but for a few minor issues, we were able top wrap up coring the NCC in about three days.</p><p>Also found a few fantastic food options through the week. For lunch we mostly had to do an Uber eats since there weren&rsquo;t many options around the new consulate. <a href=https://habaneros.com.mx/>Habaneros</a> was the find of the week though.

The syndication icon only shows up if a valid link is present in the FrontMatter of a post. Once micro.blog picks up the feed, it&rsquo;s currently set to auto publish to the fediverse on my GoToSocial (GTS) instance. On the backend, a GO script fetches the RSS feed from my GTS instance and saves the RSS feed item link and the corresponding link to my post in a JSON file. Another script quickly looks up which post&rsquo;s FrontMatter needs to be updated for the syndication links in each post and updates the files as needed. A bit windy but seems to do the job for now. I might end up consolidating these into just one script later and/or directly use the masto API to publish to the fediverse and grab the syndication link from there. For now, I&rsquo;m pretty psyched this is all working.</p></div></div><a href=/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/ class="is-note no-indent"><u>29 Nov 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list no-indent"></ol><div><p>Just struck me that most of my disk drives are quite old.

While straightforward, It felt redundant to share copies of the same pictures in multiple places. I’ve been looking for options to share album links instead that would give us a bit more control. All our photos are primarily saved in a Nextcloud self-hosted instance. I explored a few options of album shares there but wasn’t quite happy. Pixelfed was another option I explored. It did check most of the requirements but I wasn’t quite comfortable relying on a software that’s mostly dependent on just one developer. Also the unlisted feature on their albums seemed half-baked and not yet ready for prime-time. Finally played a bit with PhotoPrism and so far it seems to be something that checks all the boxes. With private links, a PWA app and great thumbnails this might be the closest solution for my photo needs.</p></div></div><a href=/2024/06/09/jmp/ class="is-note no-indent"><u>09 Jun 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list no-indent"></ol><div><p>Been looking for a Google voice number replacement for sometime now and looks like I might have found one that meets most of my needs.

The upgrade seemed to go well until it threw a PHP error which got me going in circles. In hindsight, I&rsquo;d setup automatic upgrades on NextcloudPi and Nextcloud, which seems to have conflicted with the actual distribution&rsquo;s update. Now I did take a backup, but that didn&rsquo;t quite sit well with the now upgraded system and the myriad PHP issues.</p><p>Had enough of the band-aid fixes and decided to migrate the nextcloud server to a laptop that was just lying around unused.

Around 1900 I checked my work phone and saw that Mo had texted earlier that morning asking if I would be interested in hiking Pico de Aguilar the next day. I wanted to confirm immediately but given S&rsquo;s health I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure. Decided to take a call the next morning and hit the bed. Thankfully, on Sunday morning, S seemed to have almost recovered and I decide to head out to meet Mo at his place. With some starting troubles (literally!) we finally leave for Ajusco around 0830.</p><p>The drive up is super straightforward and we park at the trailhead around 1000. We decide to take on the steeper parts of the climb first going clockwise. Around 1200 we reach Pico de Águila (12596&rsquo;) and in another 30 minutes we summit Cerro La Cruz del Marquez (12871&rsquo;). The way down from the Cerro was super steep at an 82° gradient. So glad we decided not to climb up from here and note to self to bring a knee brace for these downhills next time I hike here in CDMX. The loose volcanic soil and incessant pebbles make for dicey path downhill. We finish the hike at around 1400 and relish some hot cakes at one of the shacks at the base.</p><p>More than anything, this hike was a major morale booster after last weeks Izta attempt.</p><hr><p>2024-04-14 09:43:52 - <strong>Pico de Águila et Cerro La Cruz del Marquez</strong> 🥾 Hiked 4.69 miles in 04:50:29 Pace : 61.94 min/mile.

Troubleshooting this a bit further, I figured I did run some apt updates a few days back that triggered Kernel updates. I might now have to get into the BIOS and see if any firmware updates are pending. As luck might have it though, the current keyboard that I have functions via Bluetooth only and I can&rsquo;t quite use it to get into the BIOS.

Humanity constantly evolves from a quagmire of possibilities and there&rsquo;s very little merit in looking in retrospect. I think the likelihood of a successful forecast can only be enhanced if we work with the factors in the <strong>present</strong> - not the past, not the future. The past is barely helpful and you&rsquo;d rather not rely on those from the future. (Odd I say that after all those years I spent churning numbers as an actuarial analyst.) Ultimately what trumps is that humans find it really hard to delineate emotions from decision making. As much as you&rsquo;d like to disagree, you see it in every realm - Medicine, Finance, Sports, Academics, Health just to name a few.</p><p>In 2016, we had a fascinating <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/>close call on I-15 S</a> while heading towards New Haven. (Fascinating because, I learnt it the hard way and everyone who drives a car and has a floor-mat should be aware of this.) Accidents tend to give you that moment for retrospect and back then I jotted something similar to the thoughts I have today:</p><blockquote><p>The proverbial – ‘Everything happens for a reason’ is just not true. I believe the human brain does a wonderful job in assigning a reason to the cause and quite conveniently this is always subtly and retrospectively done. In its quest to find reason, it ends up triggering neural connections that emotionally and logically seem reasonable. So when and how do we draw the line while making choices and how do you substantiate the choices you’ve made? Or is the whole premise that as a logical and emotional machine you’re feeding good and bad data (choices) as a stimulus to train the body to better react to unforeseeable situations in the future?</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve taken <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2010/01/21/gut-instinct-twitter-and-my-career/>quite</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/08/10/for-good-for-now/>some</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/11/23/weeknote-47-shastas-first/>risky</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/10/21/flight-down-south/>shifts</a> in my career over the last decade. Most driven by what I felt at that very moment - Gut instinct. Absolutely none that I regret. And most have been very rewarding. So when it comes to making a choice at that critical moment, I try and keep retrospectives at bay. Every once in a while, I do catch myself careening from this golden rule. That&rsquo;s when I take a good pause, stop connecting the dots and look at just that isolated dot at that moment. It&rsquo;s worked wonders before and I trust that streak to continue. Irony being, my previous statement moots everything I said before! What can I say, we&rsquo;re a good bunch of optimistic morons.</p></div></div><a href=/2022/01/31/firewalls-on-thin-ice/ class="is-note no-indent"><u>31 Jan 2022</u>:</a><div class=post-content><ol class="photo-list no-indent"></ol><div><p>The more that I read and the more that I build, with every additional service that I self-host, I realize there are so many points of failure - each becoming more evident as time passes and experience grows.

This was her first longish bike ride (~10 mi) and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Riding on the roads here in India calls for a totally different skill-set. If living in a city, you need to ride through traffic to get to the trail/viewpoint and more often than not other vehicles drive totally oblivious of your existence. Miss V weaved in and out while navigating the traffic signals and it was a pleasure seeing her learn the ropes from the corner of my eye. We&rsquo;re also using bikes that are 20+ years old! So she had to deal with skipping crank-sets and loose chains! I got them to a ride-able condition a few weeks back.
