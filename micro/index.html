Quite a bit of the functionality on this page might be broken.</p><hr><a href=/2024/12/24/brake-fade/ class=is-photo><u>24 Dec 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=images/GrandVitaraCuernavaca.jpg alt></p><p>Downhill and no brakes, what fun! Definitely not at that moment though. Somewhere near Cuernavaca, The Grand Vitara had a brake fade <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> this morning on our way to Las Estacas. The brakes would just not work and it felt like I had to pump it to get even a bit of traction. Got super close to hitting the car in front of us but thankfully, I found a small lane (ditch?) to veer off from the traffic and engine braked it to a stop. Super lucky none of us were hurt and we were able to veer away from traffic just in time. Also lucky that this happened just about 100m from a mechanic shop! What are the odds? Took them about three hours to do a <del>thorough</del> check on all four wheels and fix the oil reservoir tray - which they broke while jacking the car up. Oh boy, what a start to this years&rsquo; Christmas!</p><p>Immediately after we were able to get the vehicle to a stop, M asked if it was the floor mat that was the culprit. Nope - I&rsquo;d removed them a few days after we bought this car. All thanks to another <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/>dreadful experience</a> several years ago in the Grand Cherokee.</p><p>Ignorance and oversight only make sense in hindsight. About fifteen minutes before this incident, I did notice the brakes feeling soft and remember thinking - that&rsquo;s odd the brakes worked just fine so far. Also maybe I didn&rsquo;t notice the smoke from the tires because we were driving through quasi dirt roads? All signs of the brakes giving in - had I known about brake fade then. Wee bit wiser now I guess? <a href=http://localhost:1313/2024/12/24/brake-fade/ style=text-decoration:none!important>🔗</a></p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Apparently that is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_fade>technical term</a> for a failed brake.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div><a href=/2024/12/20/merida/ class=is-note><u>20 Dec 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>Back from a productive work trip in Merida.

All hugo&rsquo;d out for now though and a short break is overdue. Super slow weekend otherwise. Watched Moana 2. Meh. Not much story but decent visuals. Tragedy of sequels, maybe?</p></div><a href=/2024/12/01/2024-12-01-003000/ class=is-note><u>01 Dec 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>Moved over the syndication links in my posts to post-meta. The syndication icon only shows up if a valid link is present in the FrontMatter of a post. Once micro.blog picks up the feed, it&rsquo;s currently set to auto publish to the fediverse on my GoToSocial (GTS) instance. On the backend, a GO script fetches the RSS feed from my GTS instance and saves the RSS feed item link and the corresponding link to my post in a JSON file. Another script quickly looks up which post&rsquo;s FrontMatter needs to be updated for the syndication links in each post and updates the files as needed. A bit windy but seems to do the job for now. I might end up consolidating these into just one script later and/or directly use the masto API to publish to the fediverse and grab the syndication link from there. For now, I&rsquo;m pretty psyched this is all working.</p></div><a href=/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/ class=is-note><u>29 Nov 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>Just struck me that most of my disk drives are quite old.

Slowly and recklessly.</p></div><a href=/2024/07/13/projects/ class=is-note><u>13 Jul 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>The pains and joys of self-hosting and tinkering. There’s always something that is broken, ready to be fixed, to be upgraded, can be built upon or changed. It is like a puzzle that constantly evolves depending on the time you invest in it. And every once in a while it exposes the silver lining that keeps you hooked to it.</p></div><a href=/2024/06/21/photoprism-albums/ class=is-note><u>21 Jun 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>M and I tend to share photos with family and friends on various chat groups. While straightforward, It felt redundant to share copies of the same pictures in multiple places. I’ve been looking for options to share album links instead that would give us a bit more control. All our photos are primarily saved in a Nextcloud self-hosted instance. I explored a few options of album shares there but wasn’t quite happy. Pixelfed was another option I explored. It did check most of the requirements but I wasn’t quite comfortable relying on a software that’s mostly dependent on just one developer. Also the unlisted feature on their albums seemed half-baked and not yet ready for prime-time. Finally played a bit with PhotoPrism and so far it seems to be something that checks all the boxes. With private links, a PWA app and great thumbnails this might be the closest solution for my photo needs.</p></div><a href=/2024/06/09/jmp/ class=is-note><u>09 Jun 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>Been looking for a Google voice number replacement for sometime now and looks like I might have found one that meets most of my needs. Just got a <a href=https://jmp.chat/>JMP number</a> and ordered a sim with a data plan. The cheogram app so far has been great and once I get the SIM I might slowly transition things out of GV.</p></div><a href=/2024/06/08/grand-vitara/ class=is-note><u>08 Jun 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>Brought the Grand Vitara home today. We’d been on the lookout for a decent car ever since we knew about our next posting. We don’t need one here in CDMX but would definitely need one in Yaounde. All I wanted was a reliable bare minimum car with no gadgetry shabangs. Over the last few months folks on their PCS did post a few decent cars but these are barely in the market for a few hours. With this one though, the stars seemed to align all well one day and we were able to seal the deal in a few hours.</p><p>Given the mileage, the GV might need some maintenance over the next few years. It rides like butter now though and reminds me of the <a href=http://0.0.0.0:8123/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/>Grand Cherokee</a> we had in NYC/BOS.</p></div><a href=/2024/06/03/bmg/ class=is-note><u>03 Jun 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=http://0.0.0.0:8123/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/imagepipe_04348564902056275560.jpg alt></p><p>Went to a Blue Man Group performance last Friday.

Ever since I consolidated all my photos, I’ve been wanting to setup a digital frame that would take us back in time on command. Some version of ‘On this day’ – but for photos. I think I have a solution that is close to what I had in mind. The photos are currently on a USB drive synced from my Nextcloud server via a cron job. I still need to work out how I choose what photos get displayed when. But so far, I am pretty happy with how this has turned out.</p></div><a href=/2024/05/17/nextcloudpi/ class=is-note><u>17 May 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>Last weekend I got a bit cocky and decided to upgrade the distro on the NextcloudPi. The upgrade seemed to go well until it threw a PHP error which got me going in circles. In hindsight, I&rsquo;d setup automatic upgrades on NextcloudPi and Nextcloud, which seems to have conflicted with the actual distribution&rsquo;s update. Now I did take a backup, but that didn&rsquo;t quite sit well with the now upgraded system and the myriad PHP issues.</p><p>Had enough of the band-aid fixes and decided to migrate the nextcloud server to a laptop that was just lying around unused. Decided to stick with the <a href=https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/>NexcloudPi OS</a> since it has served me super awesome over the last seven years. I did make sure the auto upgrades were disabled though! Also RSync is awesome!</p><p>An added  bonus is that I now have a spare RPi3 to tinker with! Not quite <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/14/pico-de-aguila/>dumbing down</a>, am I?</p></div><a href=/2024/04/14/pico-de-%C3%A1guila/ class=is-note><u>14 Apr 2024</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=images/signal-2024-04-14-17-12-24-029-2.jpg alt></p><p>S was having a rough day on Saturday and was scrunched up against me all day. Around 1900 I checked my work phone and saw that Mo had texted earlier that morning asking if I would be interested in hiking Pico de Aguilar the next day. I wanted to confirm immediately but given S&rsquo;s health I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure. Decided to take a call the next morning and hit the bed. Thankfully, on Sunday morning, S seemed to have almost recovered and I decide to head out to meet Mo at his place. With some starting troubles (literally!) we finally leave for Ajusco around 0830.</p><p>The drive up is super straightforward and we park at the trailhead around 1000. We decide to take on the steeper parts of the climb first going clockwise. Around 1200 we reach Pico de Águila (12596&rsquo;) and in another 30 minutes we summit Cerro La Cruz del Marquez (12871&rsquo;). The way down from the Cerro was super steep at an 82° gradient. So glad we decided not to climb up from here and note to self to bring a knee brace for these downhills next time I hike here in CDMX. The loose volcanic soil and incessant pebbles make for dicey path downhill. We finish the hike at around 1400 and relish some hot cakes at one of the shacks at the base.</p><p>More than anything, this hike was a major morale booster after last weeks Izta attempt.</p><hr><p>2024-04-14 09:43:52 - <strong>Pico de Águila et Cerro La Cruz del Marquez</strong> 🥾 Hiked 4.69 miles in 04:50:29 Pace : 61.94 min/mile.

Core CPU temperatures were hitting the 80s despite the system being on literally no load. When I first bought it in mid-2020, I was aware that this lineage of tiny monsters were known for their &lsquo;hot&rsquo;ness and the fan being a bit loud.  Only over the last few months have I really seen this sudden spike in temperatures though.</p><p>The first obvious step was to get rid of the plastic lid and get those aluminum heat-sinks. That helped a bit until yesterday when the temps shot to the 90s for no reason. A quick <strong>htop</strong> run didn&rsquo;t seem to show any processes that were hogging resources. Troubleshooting this a bit further, I figured I did run some apt updates a few days back that triggered Kernel updates. I might now have to get into the BIOS and see if any firmware updates are pending. As luck might have it though, the current keyboard that I have functions via Bluetooth only and I can&rsquo;t quite use it to get into the BIOS. I do have an alternate keyboard, again Bluetooth but this one comes with a USB receiver - which I conveniently left in my tech black-box in MD! 🤦 Really hope M doesn&rsquo;t forget bringing it!</p><p>For now, I installed the <strong>cpupower-gui</strong> tool and set the Governor to &lsquo;powersave&rsquo; mode.

Humanity constantly evolves from a quagmire of possibilities and there&rsquo;s very little merit in looking in retrospect. I think the likelihood of a successful forecast can only be enhanced if we work with the factors in the <strong>present</strong> - not the past, not the future. The past is barely helpful and you&rsquo;d rather not rely on those from the future. (Odd I say that after all those years I spent churning numbers as an actuarial analyst.) Ultimately what trumps is that humans find it really hard to delineate emotions from decision making. As much as you&rsquo;d like to disagree, you see it in every realm - Medicine, Finance, Sports, Academics, Health just to name a few.</p><p>In 2016, we had a fascinating <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/>close call on I-15 S</a> while heading towards New Haven. (Fascinating because, I learnt it the hard way and everyone who drives a car and has a floor-mat should be aware of this.) Accidents tend to give you that moment for retrospect and back then I jotted something similar to the thoughts I have today:</p><blockquote><p>The proverbial – ‘Everything happens for a reason’ is just not true. I believe the human brain does a wonderful job in assigning a reason to the cause and quite conveniently this is always subtly and retrospectively done. In its quest to find reason, it ends up triggering neural connections that emotionally and logically seem reasonable. So when and how do we draw the line while making choices and how do you substantiate the choices you’ve made? Or is the whole premise that as a logical and emotional machine you’re feeding good and bad data (choices) as a stimulus to train the body to better react to unforeseeable situations in the future?</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve taken <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2010/01/21/gut-instinct-twitter-and-my-career/>quite</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/08/10/for-good-for-now/>some</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/11/23/weeknote-47-shastas-first/>risky</a> <a href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/10/21/flight-down-south/>shifts</a> in my career over the last decade. Most driven by what I felt at that very moment - Gut instinct. Absolutely none that I regret. And most have been very rewarding. So when it comes to making a choice at that critical moment, I try and keep retrospectives at bay. Every once in a while, I do catch myself careening from this golden rule. That&rsquo;s when I take a good pause, stop connecting the dots and look at just that isolated dot at that moment. It&rsquo;s worked wonders before and I trust that streak to continue. Irony being, my previous statement moots everything I said before! What can I say, we&rsquo;re a good bunch of optimistic morons.</p></div><a href=/2022/01/31/firewalls-on-thin-ice/ class=is-note><u>31 Jan 2022</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>The more that I read and the more that I build, with every additional service that I self-host, I realize there are so many points of failure - each becoming more evident as time passes and experience grows.

With this setup, I get to stay clear of the tracking and ads [Last time I checked uBlock Origin blocked 90 trackers/ads in 3 minutes!] and more importantly use my website as the primary place where I post. While I am not quite active on twitter, this should be a great go-between to reconnect with folks who use it for their primary digital presence.</p></div><a href=/2021/04/25/april-25-2021-1552/ class=is-note><u>25 Apr 2021</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>Meena&rsquo;s been interested in building our family tree for a while now. Installed Gramps on her machine and she&rsquo;s feeding this nifty application with all the family data. This is going to be an extended project and can&rsquo;t wait to see what comes out of it. Haven&rsquo;t researched much but looks like Gramps does not have a shared/collaborative edit features.

This was her first longish bike ride (~10 mi) and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Riding on the roads here in India calls for a totally different skill-set. If living in a city, you need to ride through traffic to get to the trail/viewpoint and more often than not other vehicles drive totally oblivious of your existence. Miss V weaved in and out while navigating the traffic signals and it was a pleasure seeing her learn the ropes from the corner of my eye. We&rsquo;re also using bikes that are 20+ years old! So she had to deal with skipping crank-sets and loose chains! I got them to a ride-able condition a few weeks back. However, bike maintenance is overdue and now&rsquo;s probably the best time to get her into that too.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=images/Imagepipe_1-1200x900.jpg alt></p></div><a href=/2021/04/18/april-18-2021-1640/ class=is-note><u>18 Apr 2021</u>:</a><div class=post-content><p>Whoa..That&rsquo;s awesome!
