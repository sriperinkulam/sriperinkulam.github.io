Mobile signal and internet is apparently down in Yaounde. The pot&rsquo;s slowly boiling and the city is expected to be on a hightened state of alert on Monday and Tuesday. Issa seems to be playing his cards real well! Hoping this doesn&rsquo;t mess up my travel!</p><p>Spent most of my work day doing some fun troubleshooting and long needed housekeeping.

Got to Douala in pretty decent time - 3.5 hrs. Roads were pretty empty and we did get to see the local police using drones to catch speeding traffic on the highway!</p><p>Miss being in a place that celebrates Diwali. As a kid this was one of those days when we would get that one pair of new clothes! Carefully stitched so it would last at least three years. Crackers, snacks, smoke, diyas, explosions&mldr;i want it all. Dawn to dusk and deep into the night. This year though it all turned out so M&amp;S are in London and I&rsquo;m by myself in Douala. WTF does &lsquo;Happy Diwali&rsquo; even mean? Ugh!</p><p>Quick catchup with work in the EBO and head to the hotel.</p><p>K Hotel here does not sell coke.

Thankfully we have decent savings. Also does help that the state department has always paid two weeks late. This paycheck should be about 70% my regular paycheck accounting for work done until Sep 30th. There&rsquo;s talk of this shutdown maybe making it to Thanksgiving. Historically, they&rsquo;ve responded when ATC / TSA folks threw in their towels&mldr;This time around might be different though.</p><p>M wants to go to London with S.

I&rsquo;ve been considering getting a document scanner to digest these files digitally and get rid of them. It&rsquo;s been on my mind for a few years now and I think I&rsquo;ve reached that decision threshold to bite the bullet and get a scanner. Now these devices run anywhere between 200 and 600 USD that I am NOT interested in spending for this indulgence. I&rsquo;ll most likely hunt for one on ebay or <a href=https://www.backmarket.com/>backmarket</a> sticking to my <a href=/uses>recycled hardware whenever feasible</a> stand. The <em>Fujitsu Fi 6130</em> seems to fit that &lsquo;cheap and best&rsquo; bucket if sourced second hand. They seem to be selling for about 70 USD.

Spent most of this morning building this RC fella. S received this &rsquo;lego&rsquo; kit as a gift for Christmas last year.</p><p>One of those frustrating yet terrific builds.

Did she use the bathroom before we head out? Did I keep a spare set of clothes with me? Will I find the food that she might like in the new place? If not, did I have enough snack options for her? Do I need to get her clothes washed in this city or the next? Which PJ set would she like tonight? How do I coax her to sleep despite all the flux around her? What am I forgetting?&mldr;</p><p>And to not do that, now that she isn&rsquo;t with me, It feels odd.
