Super thrilled! The last twelve months has been crazy busy with lots of travel amidst heavy uncertainty. And our PCS move last week has been nothing different. We&amp;rsquo;re still waiting on Travel Order amendments but we were able to cost-construct our travel with some timely help from the GSO at the Chennai Consulate. A week of festivities in the family and we should be moving to Virginia for the next several weeks. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to know my posting on Flag-day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks my last day as a Certifying officer with USAID. Quite typical with my previous career moves, there was a fair share of uncertainty when I signed up for this position. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very sure what exactly I was getting into and I guess that was likely the draw too. It&amp;rsquo;s been a terrific year and a half - Timing our relocation amidst the pandemic, Sifting between remote and on-premises, moving from the States and between the States, Balancing team and personality dynamics and over the last couple months - making the most of our time in Delhi. I&amp;rsquo;ll cherish my time here over the next several years and walk out having met and worked with some awesome colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, I am pretty psyched on our next move. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming and would mark a good transition from being a generalist to a specialist. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the randomness, surprises and ofcourse a good bunch of travel to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>For Good, For Now</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meena, Shasta and I moved back to India from the US a few days back with bags and no baggage! With most of my family in the states, this was one tough decision to take and it has been on our minds for the last three to four years. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://channel.srikanthperinkulam.com/content/all/?q=uganda&#34;&gt;2018 vacation in Uganda&lt;/a&gt; solidified our resolve to enter the Foreign Service and work towards a more holistic life that involved sustainable travel. During one of those long car rides, we decided it was time and planned to &amp;lsquo;initiate exit procedures&amp;rsquo; right after our vacation. Just as we were finalizing things back in the US, we&amp;rsquo;d realized that we would be having Shasta that year and decided to push the move to next year. Come 2019, once we had Shasta&amp;rsquo;s paperwork in place and she was ready to fly, we head back to Uganda to spend a few months there with Meena&amp;rsquo;s father and finally made our way to India with a short stay in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I resigned from WTW in April and decided to take some time off to spend with Shasta. She&amp;rsquo;s growing way too fast and I am beyond thrilled that I am able to spend some real quality time with her and Meena. On the work front, working towards the FS career, I passed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://channel.srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/checked-into-or-tambo-international-terminal&#34;&gt;IMST test in May&lt;/a&gt; and am very optimistic of a call for the Oral Assessments. Though with anything in the foreign service, this is going to be one long shot and highly likely it&amp;rsquo;s going to be at-least a year for things to start shaping up. Spinning in tandem, I have an interim offer for a job in the U.S Embassy in Kampala. The security clearance is currently underway for over 10 months now and I am now cutting it wee closer to the September deadline. Fingers crossed! In the interim, I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping few universities in Uganda with their branding and plan to kick-start online test-prep courses for the GRE and SAT through W2SG. There&amp;rsquo;s another opportunity in Maine, U.S. that I might explore a few months down the lane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest of 2019 is going to be as fluid as the last few months have been and I trust things will start shaping out soon. The other day, I was telling Meena how straightforward this all looks in retrospect - we were mulling over it over several interspersed discussions across years and all it takes is a few hours for one to uproot, move and get settled to a new normal! Friends and family keep asking us if our move to India is permanent. We tell them it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;For good, for now&amp;rsquo;. I coined that phrase not knowing any better way to describe the shift we&amp;rsquo;re going through and the more I think of it, the more I like it! At the least, it does make the discussion a bit lighter!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shasta</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2018/11/20/shasta/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about 2 AM and I am on a side bed in Sinai Hospital. Earlier today (yesterday) Meena and I brought into this world a sparkingly beautiful 7lb 5oz girl. I remember seeing Meena during the institute at TFI with some of her school kids and thinking she would be a wonderful mother one day. Eight years from then, as I see this little munchkin in the crib beside her, I am more than thankful for all that has led to this day. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled beyond limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/20181130_2349301.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tara, Zara, Agni, Annapurna were all front runners for the name. With our mutual love for the mountains and belief that the name should exude power and confidence, we eventually zeroed in on Shasta. I first came across the name on a Dirtbag diaries podcast - &lt;a href=&#34;http://dirtbagdiaries.com/flying-deep/&#34;&gt;Flying Deep&lt;/a&gt;. I profusely liked the way it sounded and the fact that Mt. Shasta was a towering, potentially active volcano sealed the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m psyched that we&amp;rsquo;re naming her after a mountain. While climbing up a peak or on the ridge, I always feel the eerie and calming sense of belonging. It always reminds me of days spent in the hospital living by the day&amp;hellip;a mixed bag of memories I so wish, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have, yet I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful I do&amp;hellip; Somewhere deep under I knew Amma wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make it. She&amp;rsquo;d been swinging in and out of consciousness for several months now. One of those lucky days in November 1999, her vitals seemed reasonably stable. She was longing for some fresh air and I was able to finagle one of the nurses to take us outdoors. We took amma on a wheelchair to the terrace of the hospital. It was a dark, chilly and breezy night. Hyderabad was just about wrapping up its Diwali celebrations. Far down where our vision could stretch, every now and then a rocket would shoot up and the fireworks would brighten up the sky. Amma was thrilled! As another waft of cold air blew on the terrace, amma clenched my fists and said &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been this high on the mountains. This is the most beautiful sun rise I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen&amp;rdquo;. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take us a lot to figure out she was having yet another bout of hallucination. The last few months the medications were wrecking havoc. This time though on that terrace, I felt a sense of thankfulness. For this, was one of those moments when I could see that child-like sparkle in her eyes, something that would remain captured in my memories of her and something which I&amp;rsquo;d never see again&amp;hellip;forever. From that day, Mountains and more so sunrise on those ridges took a whole different meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days back, as we floated the name within the family circle, one of my cousin&amp;rsquo;s mentioned Shasta meant &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; in Sanskrit. Meena and I met through a teaching fellowship and I thought it was pretty awesome that we ended up naming our kid - Shasta! Shasta, also happens to be a reference to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasta_%28deity%29#Kerala&#34;&gt;south Indian Hindu deity&lt;/a&gt; that my ancestors have long worshiped. All in all we seem to have appeased all generations!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the middle name we decided to just leave it as R, depicting Ratna - amma&amp;rsquo;s name, Rajesh - a dear cousin of mine who committed suicide a few years back and Ramu anna - another cousin who &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2018/08/13/ramu-anna/&#34;&gt;very recently&lt;/a&gt; passed away fighting cancer. The hope is that we&amp;rsquo;re saliently reminded of them all through Shasta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I can&amp;rsquo;t quite foresee the future, I believe we do have in mind the kind of person we would like to raise. The world at this point in time has a lot of negative things going on. We hope as Shasta grows and develops a personality of her own, she does so much more than what we&amp;rsquo;ve done to bring in more positivity around her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>WFA Certified</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/1519769065.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;Over the last 12 or so years that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hiking now, I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a ton from my goof-ups. I believe in taking calculated risks and am reasonably okay with &amp;lsquo;winging&amp;rsquo; a hike as long as I have the right gear and know what the game-plan is. Still, every hike that I&amp;rsquo;ve been on and the deeper I&amp;rsquo;ve been into the wilderness, I&amp;rsquo;ve always pondered what would happen if either me or someone in the group needed medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last year, I joined the REI co-op and the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) and through them heard about a slew of courses one could take part in to be better prepared while out there in the wilderness. The first-aid course did get my attention. One of those things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do for quite sometime now but never got around taking the time and effort to work on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, not anymore! Early this month I attended a wilderness first-aid (WFA) certification course organized by NOLS. It was a short yet extremely insightful course on responding to different situations one might encounter while deep in the wilderness. The course was more aligned to situational leadership and had several elements on training your mind to work on a methodical and well thought through set of actions [The SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan) approach apparently pretty commonly used in the medical field]. We were also introduced to regular first-aid skills for patient care and some basic wilderness survival do&amp;rsquo;s and dont&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With day long sessions and several practical scenario try-outs this was one long rewarding weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to make sure I practice those skills intermittently just so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget them. To delve deeper, I&amp;rsquo;ll possibly sign up for the Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course sometime later this year. Winter is almost on its way out and I eagerly look forward to spring and summer to get some good long hikes in this year!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/cropped-cropped-SP01-550afdebv1_site_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com&#34;&gt;Srikanth Perinkulam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all winds back to a random October afternoon in 2012. Meena and I were driving around in Chennai finishing up some printing errands when we have this discussion on students, schools and graduate programs. We were trying to figure out tier A, B and C schools for a student whom her dad was counselling and midst that discussion, I happen to mention I should apply to schools just for the heck of it. The moment freezes and she gives me the typical &amp;lsquo;Meena-look&amp;rsquo; and says - &amp;lsquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s do it!&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We drive back home and speak to her Mom and Dad to pick  their brains. Both are thrilled - to say the least. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to complete a Master&amp;rsquo;s but for a long time wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure which specialization to major in. We deliberate on how Actuarial Science is such a wonderful fit for me and why now is a good time. For the last few months we&amp;rsquo;ve been in a flux with Meena&amp;rsquo;s grad school admit, the immigrant visa situation and a slew of other things. This would only add further complications or rather - &amp;ldquo;Happy Problems&amp;rdquo; as the Bhaskars put it (and something I&amp;rsquo;ve come to really appreciate now).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That very day, we sit down to look-up universities and admission deadlines and even before I knew I&amp;rsquo;d applied to five schools - all in a span of 2-3 days. Days roll by and late February 2013 as I sit staring at coconut trees in my maternal grand-mothers house in Trivandrum the admit from Columbia creeps in. As I call and inform Meena and her parents of the admit offer, they&amp;rsquo;re electrified! I knew Columbia was a good school, really liked their electives but honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t really know that this was a great deal.  I&amp;rsquo;d received an offer from another good university a few days back but chose to go ahead with Columbia for its obvious network benefits and city-location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summer 2013, I eventually start the program and from then on - it&amp;rsquo;s been a great mix of experiences and surprises. Getting back into student-shoes after six long years has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Mottled with assignments, classes, internships, examinations, deadlines, projects, presentations and seminars - The last year and a half has been a great fire-up! Having the opportunity to meet some incredible people and take classes with some really great professors by itself was a huge learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, to me personally If my $100,000 education was any worth it, it was because of a statement that one of the professors&amp;rsquo; I really look up to kept mentioning -&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;d like you all to take from my class it&amp;rsquo;s this - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It takes years and years to earn reputation of integrity, but just a second to lose it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sounds cliché - but just to hear it from somebody who you consider a role model, mention it every semester class; totally drives home the point. And for that I&amp;rsquo;m truly thankful to everybody - family and friends who&amp;rsquo;ve been instrumental in getting me here to where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the Masters&amp;rsquo; taken care of, the next short-term career goal is to earn my fellowship credentials in the next few years. It&amp;rsquo;s a steep up-curve but I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the ride and am more than thrilled to have chosen this path. Exciting times ahead!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cleared the second Actuarial Exam today! Set the chopper as an incentive for me to pass some months back. Eventually grew out of it and was later gifted a fitbit by wifey. The chopper here was gifted by us to a roommate who&amp;rsquo;d cleared this exam earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this one exam took quite some effort to clear. Thrilled and am just not able to sleep. Here&amp;rsquo;s to the flight on a dark crystal night!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Crossing the rickety bridge...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was my last day in Infosys - An end of  2.8yrs of  learning to be a software engineer and trying to &amp;lsquo;fit in the groove&amp;rsquo; for having followed the mass psyche&amp;hellip;Thankfully before it got too late,  I realised IT wasn&amp;rsquo;t really my cup of tea and decided to trust my instincts rather than follow the herd. There&amp;rsquo;s so much that Infosys as a company has taught me in this short span that I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;d reflect back to those wonderful days and experiences over time as I switch roles and careers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this tradition that folks out here follow of sending an adieu e-mail on the last day and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to break it. So here goes mine&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BCC Intentional&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On March 10th, even before dawn breaks in, I would be out there on the asphalt roads - Running and training like never before. As I fix my morning breakfast and coffee, I would no longer have to bother about missing the 07:00am Bus. The very thought that I would not have to travel 30kms to reach my workplace gives me a sense a freedom like never before. Life’s just getting better by the day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I walk out of the gates on 9th, my 2.8 yrs in Infosys would come to an end. And today as I look back, I see I’ve taken more than what I’ve given to the company. It’s been a stupendous journey. I was lucky to be part of a budding unit and to have real cool managers; to be in a Production support project for about eight months and then a Process centric project for close to 1.5years. I never was keen on doing technical stuff and I’m so glad I wasn’t compelled to do it either! I flunked my certification five times and I’ve absolutely no regrets. The day I was offered a job as a Software engineer, I decided I would work on my terms and would not accept subjugation at any cost. I somehow felt my personal life was far more important than my work life. I stood by Kantabai’s philosophy [Itna Paisa Mein Itna Ich Milenga] and most of the days; I was in by 8 and out by 5. I can count on my fingers the number of days I’ve worked over time or over the weekends - All this without sacrificing on timelines or deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering my interests, Both the LexisNexis project at Pune and the Pfizer Change Management project here in Hyderabad have been highly satisfying. I simply couldn’t have bargained for more! Liaising with various teams across timezones, Scheduling releases and the best part - Anchoring escalation calls is something I’d cherish for years to come. I still wonder why people are so much against working in non-technical projects. There’s an equal amount of pressure and thrill involved and neither really gives you more pay than the other&amp;hellip;So what’s the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, Infosys has given me an amazing platform to meet and network with quite a few real cool and interesting people. I’ve been part of dance teams [Hyd Milan ‘08] and skit plays [Raheem beedi!] which I’m sure I wouldn’t have pitched into but for my amazing team mates. I’ve been part of outdoor adventure groups [AdVentura and eventually HydVentura] and Biking groups [Thunderbolts] which I’m badly going to miss as I plummet out of Infosys in a couple of days.  I picked up the guitar and tried my hands at Budokan Karate.[Haven’t made much progress on these but am sure will get back to complete this unfinished job!]. I’m going to miss all the events and DJ nights that keep happening so very frequently. And last but not the least I’m going to badly miss you folks who’ve always been out there to mimic back those thirty-two shining teeth. The lunches, the outings, the coffee breaks and the cross cubicle volley-ball games - It’s as if I’m putting a full-stop abruptly and vanishing out into the blue…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I’m shit excited. Excited about the uncertainty that’s going to be with me, about the financial instability, about the responsibilities I’d be taking on, about the people I’m going to meet and more so about the kids whom I’ll be teaching and eventually learning from for the next two years. I’ve still not exactly figured what I’m going to do with my life. But I guess that’s what’ll keep me on my feet every day from now. Post my fellowship at TeachforIndia, I would probably pursue my childhood dream of having a ‘Dr.’ in front of my name or probably start something of my own. There are a lot of ifs and buts involved and I hope to figure the evens and odds in the two month break that I’d be taking. Guess I’ll just do what I’m best at – Backpacking across the country, trying to sink with the locals and take some real good time off. This phase of my life would probably be about crossing the narrow rickety bridge spanning hundreds of metres over a deep ravine - Options galore, But not really sure of what&amp;rsquo;s at the other end&amp;hellip;Life&amp;rsquo;s just getting fabulous!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One March 9th, One chapter ends and yet another begins and before I put a bookmark; I just want to stop by and thank you for having made this one memorable journey, to say the least.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to wake up in the morning and find the day ahead unpredictable. I wanted to think on my toes and look for a challenging day ahead that would need me to take decisions on the fly. I wanted to have a slice of &amp;lsquo;adventure&amp;rsquo; every day in my life. Over time I realised its more promising to trust your gut instinct than anything else. I personally feel relying on &amp;lsquo;gut instinct&amp;rsquo; is not just doing things impulsively but It&amp;rsquo;s more about taking decisions on the fly which inherently is strengthened over time based on your past experiences through a subconscious thought process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year and a half back I signed off my &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;../2008/07/the-it-mirage/&#34;&gt;one year in IT&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; post with this statement- &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Probably I’ll be doing something starkly different next year or for all you know still be eluded by the mirage of recognition all the way lamenting ‘C’est la Vie ‘ and keep moving&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rsquo; Little did I realise what was concocting. I should have seen this coming way back then. Three months from now I&amp;rsquo;ll be making a paradigm shift in my career and what else do I attribute this to but for &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/rohan_kini/status/3665859697&#34;&gt;one of Rohan Kini&amp;rsquo;s tweet!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;imgs/20241208-013310.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess its time I unofficially announce [For records!] my decision to move out of  the role of a Software engineer and walk into the role of a teacher.  I was intimated on my selection for this fellowship on Nov 30th itself  but I guess it took me another two months to digest the fact. I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining a team of 150 fellows selected from various professions all across the country to mentor kids in low income schools. For two whole years, as a fellow of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.teachforindia.org/&#34;&gt;Teach for India&lt;/a&gt;, I would be working with the kids, their communities and their familes to help improve the literacy numbers. The very thought that I would be responsible in moulding the lifes of about fifty kids over a span of two years sends a chill down my spine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been an excruciating three whole months process and I still remember checking my mail every half an hour on my mobile on Nov 30th awaiting the confirmation response from the team. [I probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t this anxious even during my Infosys interview!] I applied for the fellowship right the next day I got to hear about the program through Rohans&amp;rsquo; tweet. Initially I assumed this would be a cakewalk. But after a couple of days the structured process that was in place to take in the second set of fellows became evident. SOPs, Recommendation letters, Telephonic interviews and a day long in-person interview  - Boy, I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t prepared for all this! I in fact didn&amp;rsquo;t even inform my family members till the day of the Assessment interview!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Post my selection, life&amp;rsquo;s been a bit different. People kind of do not look at me the same way. All optimistic views aside, moving out of a stable job to unknown realms is at times unnerving. I&amp;rsquo;ve been receiving mixed responses from my colleagues and friends when they get to hear about my decision. It at times bothers when you hear your colleagues earning a higher pay as they switch jobs. To be frank, in the initial few days I was even thinking of scrapping all plans and banking on the safe job that I had. But as I got to speak to the current fellows and the program co-ordinators things really got better. A much deeper analysis and ground work put things on the brighter perspective. Besides this decision also had direct implication on what I wanted to do ever since I started teaching at the Arundati upper primary school. That one day changed the way I looked at things. Just two hours and I was already emphasizing on the need for a much regular workable model to help the kids improve and I guess this is where my gut instinct played a vital role. If I was not interested in the program I simply wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have applied for the fellowship impromptu. With that single ideology I sent in my confirmation on Dec &amp;lsquo;07th despite having time till Jan 03rd.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next two years is probably going to be the best learning experience I could ask for. I would need to work on issues I&amp;rsquo;ve never thought of  and look at things from a grass root level perspective. I would need to think twice before I spend every pie from my pocket and learn to un-learn some things that &amp;lsquo;corporate life&amp;rsquo; has taught me. I would need to think out of the box and bring about innovative ideas to help improve the current scenario. To be frank, I still do not have a clear cut picture as to what I should/would be doing post this fellowship. Guess I&amp;rsquo;ll take it in stride and figure out things as they roll out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I came across this talk by the CEO of Teach For India - Shaheen Mistry at the TEDxASB event. You seriously need to watch this to see what this is all about. Nothing short of a three stomped salute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;p style=&amp;ldquo;text-align:justify&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;India as a developing nation needs institutions such as this to help bring about change. Change in the way we respond to the seething demons that are deep rooted in our day to day lives. Unless Illiteracy, Poverty and Corruption are brought under control, there&amp;rsquo;s remote chance that we as a Nation stand to a glorious future. Philanthropy or Altruism come nowhere in the picture. All that is required is human force that believes in setting things straight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
