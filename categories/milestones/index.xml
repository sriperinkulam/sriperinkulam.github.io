&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years of focused effort, this July 5th, I will be taking the Oath of Office as a Foreign Service Specialist. Super thrilled! The last twelve months has been crazy busy with lots of travel amidst heavy uncertainty. And our PCS move last week has been nothing different. We&amp;rsquo;re still waiting on Travel Order amendments but we were able to cost-construct our travel with some timely help from the GSO at the Chennai Consulate. A week of festivities in the family and we should be moving to Virginia for the next several weeks. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to know my posting on Flag-day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks my last day as a Certifying officer with USAID. Quite typical with my previous career moves, there was a fair share of uncertainty when I signed up for this position. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very sure what exactly I was getting into and I guess that was likely the draw too. It&amp;rsquo;s been a terrific year and a half - Timing our relocation amidst the pandemic, Sifting between remote and on-premises, moving from the States and between the States, Balancing team and personality dynamics and over the last couple months - making the most of our time in Delhi. I&amp;rsquo;ll cherish my time here over the next several years and walk out having met and worked with some awesome colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I am pretty psyched on our next move. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming and would mark a good transition from being a generalist to a specialist. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the randomness, surprises and ofcourse a good bunch of travel to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meena, Shasta and I moved back to India from the US a few days back with bags and no baggage! With most of my family in the states, this was one tough decision to take and it has been on our minds for the last three to four years. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://channel.srikanthperinkulam.com/content/all/?q=uganda&#34;&gt;2018 vacation in Uganda&lt;/a&gt; solidified our resolve to enter the Foreign Service and work towards a more holistic life that involved sustainable travel. During one of those long car rides, we decided it was time and planned to &amp;lsquo;initiate exit procedures&amp;rsquo; right after our vacation. Just as we were finalizing things back in the US, we&amp;rsquo;d realized that we would be having Shasta that year and decided to push the move to next year. Come 2019, once we had Shasta&amp;rsquo;s paperwork in place and she was ready to fly, we head back to Uganda to spend a few months there with Meena&amp;rsquo;s father and finally made our way to India with a short stay in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resigned from WTW in April and decided to take some time off to spend with Shasta. She&amp;rsquo;s growing way too fast and I am beyond thrilled that I am able to spend some real quality time with her and Meena. On the work front, working towards the FS career, I passed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://channel.srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/checked-into-or-tambo-international-terminal&#34;&gt;IMST test in May&lt;/a&gt; and am very optimistic of a call for the Oral Assessments. Though with anything in the foreign service, this is going to be one long shot and highly likely it&amp;rsquo;s going to be at-least a year for things to start shaping up. Spinning in tandem, I have an interim offer for a job in the U.S Embassy in Kampala. The security clearance is currently underway for over 10 months now and I am now cutting it wee closer to the September deadline. Fingers crossed! In the interim, I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping few universities in Uganda with their branding and plan to kick-start online test-prep courses for the GRE and SAT through W2SG. There&amp;rsquo;s another opportunity in Maine, U.S. that I might explore a few months down the lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of 2019 is going to be as fluid as the last few months have been and I trust things will start shaping out soon. The other day, I was telling Meena how straightforward this all looks in retrospect - we were mulling over it over several interspersed discussions across years and all it takes is a few hours for one to uproot, move and get settled to a new normal! Friends and family keep asking us if our move to India is permanent. We tell them it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;For good, for now&amp;rsquo;. I coined that phrase not knowing any better way to describe the shift we&amp;rsquo;re going through and the more I think of it, the more I like it! At the least, it does make the discussion a bit lighter!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about 2 AM and I am on a side bed in Sinai Hospital. Earlier today (yesterday) Meena and I brought into this world a sparkingly beautiful 7lb 5oz girl. I remember seeing Meena during the institute at TFI with some of her school kids and thinking she would be a wonderful mother one day. Eight years from then, as I see this little munchkin in the crib beside her, I am more than thankful for all that has led to this day. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled beyond limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/20181130_2349301.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara, Zara, Agni, Annapurna were all front runners for the name. With our mutual love for the mountains and belief that the name should exude power and confidence, we eventually zeroed in on Shasta. I first came across the name on a Dirtbag diaries podcast - &lt;a href=&#34;http://dirtbagdiaries.com/flying-deep/&#34;&gt;Flying Deep&lt;/a&gt;. I profusely liked the way it sounded and the fact that Mt. Shasta was a towering, potentially active volcano sealed the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m psyched that we&amp;rsquo;re naming her after a mountain. While climbing up a peak or on the ridge, I always feel the eerie and calming sense of belonging. It always reminds me of days spent in the hospital living by the day&amp;hellip;a mixed bag of memories I so wish, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have, yet I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful I do&amp;hellip; Somewhere deep under I knew Amma wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make it. She&amp;rsquo;d been swinging in and out of consciousness for several months now. One of those lucky days in November 1999, her vitals seemed reasonably stable. She was longing for some fresh air and I was able to finagle one of the nurses to take us outdoors. We took amma on a wheelchair to the terrace of the hospital. It was a dark, chilly and breezy night. Hyderabad was just about wrapping up its Diwali celebrations. Far down where our vision could stretch, every now and then a rocket would shoot up and the fireworks would brighten up the sky. Amma was thrilled! As another waft of cold air blew on the terrace, amma clenched my fists and said &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been this high on the mountains. This is the most beautiful sun rise I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen&amp;rdquo;. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take us a lot to figure out she was having yet another bout of hallucination. The last few months the medications were wrecking havoc. This time though on that terrace, I felt a sense of thankfulness. For this, was one of those moments when I could see that child-like sparkle in her eyes, something that would remain captured in my memories of her and something which I&amp;rsquo;d never see again&amp;hellip;forever. From that day, Mountains and more so sunrise on those ridges took a whole different meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days back, as we floated the name within the family circle, one of my cousin&amp;rsquo;s mentioned Shasta meant &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; in Sanskrit. Meena and I met through a teaching fellowship and I thought it was pretty awesome that we ended up naming our kid - Shasta! Shasta, also happens to be a reference to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasta_%28deity%29#Kerala&#34;&gt;south Indian Hindu deity&lt;/a&gt; that my ancestors have long worshiped. All in all we seem to have appeased all generations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the middle name we decided to just leave it as R, depicting Ratna - amma&amp;rsquo;s name, Rajesh - a dear cousin of mine who committed suicide a few years back and Ramu anna - another cousin who &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2018/08/13/ramu-anna/&#34;&gt;very recently&lt;/a&gt; passed away fighting cancer. The hope is that we&amp;rsquo;re saliently reminded of them all through Shasta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can&amp;rsquo;t quite foresee the future, I believe we do have in mind the kind of person we would like to raise. The world at this point in time has a lot of negative things going on. We hope as Shasta grows and develops a personality of her own, she does so much more than what we&amp;rsquo;ve done to bring in more positivity around her.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last 12 or so years that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hiking now, I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a ton from my goof-ups. I believe in taking calculated risks and am reasonably okay with &amp;lsquo;winging&amp;rsquo; a hike as long as I have the right gear and know what the game-plan is. Still, every hike that I&amp;rsquo;ve been on and the deeper I&amp;rsquo;ve been into the wilderness, I&amp;rsquo;ve always pondered what would happen if either me or someone in the group needed medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I joined the REI co-op and the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) and through them heard about a slew of courses one could take part in to be better prepared while out there in the wilderness. The first-aid course did get my attention. One of those things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do for quite sometime now but never got around taking the time and effort to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not anymore! Early this month I attended a wilderness first-aid (WFA) certification course organized by NOLS. It was a short yet extremely insightful course on responding to different situations one might encounter while deep in the wilderness. The course was more aligned to situational leadership and had several elements on training your mind to work on a methodical and well thought through set of actions [The SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan) approach apparently pretty commonly used in the medical field]. We were also introduced to regular first-aid skills for patient care and some basic wilderness survival do&amp;rsquo;s and dont&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With day long sessions and several practical scenario try-outs this was one long rewarding weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to make sure I practice those skills intermittently just so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget them. To delve deeper, I&amp;rsquo;ll possibly sign up for the Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course sometime later this year. Winter is almost on its way out and I eagerly look forward to spring and summer to get some good long hikes in this year!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all winds back to a random October afternoon in 2012. Meena and I were driving around in Chennai finishing up some printing errands when we have this discussion on students, schools and graduate programs. We were trying to figure out tier A, B and C schools for a student whom her dad was counselling and midst that discussion, I happen to mention I should apply to schools just for the heck of it. The moment freezes and she gives me the typical &amp;lsquo;Meena-look&amp;rsquo; and says - &amp;lsquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s do it!&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drive back home and speak to her Mom and Dad to pick  their brains. Both are thrilled - to say the least. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to complete a Master&amp;rsquo;s but for a long time wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure which specialization to major in. We deliberate on how Actuarial Science is such a wonderful fit for me and why now is a good time. For the last few months we&amp;rsquo;ve been in a flux with Meena&amp;rsquo;s grad school admit, the immigrant visa situation and a slew of other things. This would only add further complications or rather - &amp;ldquo;Happy Problems&amp;rdquo; as the Bhaskars put it (and something I&amp;rsquo;ve come to really appreciate now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That very day, we sit down to look-up universities and admission deadlines and even before I knew I&amp;rsquo;d applied to five schools - all in a span of 2-3 days. Days roll by and late February 2013 as I sit staring at coconut trees in my maternal grand-mothers house in Trivandrum the admit from Columbia creeps in. As I call and inform Meena and her parents of the admit offer, they&amp;rsquo;re electrified! I knew Columbia was a good school, really liked their electives but honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t really know that this was a great deal.  I&amp;rsquo;d received an offer from another good university a few days back but chose to go ahead with Columbia for its obvious network benefits and city-location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer 2013, I eventually start the program and from then on - it&amp;rsquo;s been a great mix of experiences and surprises. Getting back into student-shoes after six long years has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Mottled with assignments, classes, internships, examinations, deadlines, projects, presentations and seminars - The last year and a half has been a great fire-up! Having the opportunity to meet some incredible people and take classes with some really great professors by itself was a huge learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, to me personally If my $100,000 education was any worth it, it was because of a statement that one of the professors&amp;rsquo; I really look up to kept mentioning -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;d like you all to take from my class it&amp;rsquo;s this - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It takes years and years to earn reputation of integrity, but just a second to lose it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds cliché - but just to hear it from somebody who you consider a role model, mention it every semester class; totally drives home the point. And for that I&amp;rsquo;m truly thankful to everybody - family and friends who&amp;rsquo;ve been instrumental in getting me here to where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Masters&amp;rsquo; taken care of, the next short-term career goal is to earn my fellowship credentials in the next few years. It&amp;rsquo;s a steep up-curve but I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the ride and am more than thrilled to have chosen this path. Exciting times ahead!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It all winds back to a random October afternoon in 2012. Meena and I were driving around in Chennai finishing up some printing errands when we have this discussion on students, schools and graduate programs. We were trying to figure out tier A, B and C schools for a student whom her dad was counselling and midst that discussion, I happen to mention I should apply to schools just for the heck of it. The moment freezes and she gives me the typical &lsquo;Meena-look&rsquo; and says - &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We drive back home and speak to her Mom and Dad to pick  their brains. Both are thrilled - to say the least. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to complete a Master&rsquo;s but for a long time wasn&rsquo;t really sure which specialization to major in. We deliberate on how Actuarial Science is such a wonderful fit for me and why now is a good time. For the last few months we&rsquo;ve been in a flux with Meena&rsquo;s grad school admit, the immigrant visa situation and a slew of other things. This would only add further complications or rather - &ldquo;Happy Problems&rdquo; as the Bhaskars put it (and something I&rsquo;ve come to really appreciate now).</p>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleared the second Actuarial Exam today! Set the chopper as an incentive for me to pass some months back. Eventually grew out of it and was later gifted a fitbit by wifey. The chopper here was gifted by us to a roommate who&amp;rsquo;d cleared this exam earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this one exam took quite some effort to clear. Thrilled and am just not able to sleep. Here&amp;rsquo;s to the flight on a dark crystal night!&lt;/p&gt;
