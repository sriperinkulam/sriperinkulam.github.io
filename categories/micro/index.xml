      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordered a Kobo Clara BW for M on a whim. Been a while that I&amp;rsquo;ve surprised her! Twelve years ago when I gifted her the Kindle she was initially super upset - we barely had any money then. This time around when she opened it, her reaction was neutral at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting it up wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite intuitive. Took me 20 minutes to figure out that the software wasn&amp;rsquo;t showing the option for overdrive sync because it sensed our location to be outside US/Canada. An easy fix until we hit the next issue - M only has a Libby account and that does not map 1:1 to an Overdrive account. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll have to setup an overdrive account now, add all her library cards and then sync that account in the Kobo. Reasonable ask I guess. But doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help my case of getting her to try off mainstream devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;S just got back from a week long camping trip in &lt;a href=&#34;https://pipiol.com/&#34;&gt;Pipiol&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time she&amp;rsquo;s been away from M or me overnight and she seems to have handled it real well! Super proud of her! All credit goes to her school for prepping the class right from the very beginning of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I got a bit cocky and decided to upgrade the distro on the NextcloudPi. The upgrade seemed to go well until it threw a PHP error which got me going in circles. In hindsight, I&amp;rsquo;d setup automatic upgrades on NextcloudPi and Nextcloud, which seems to have conflicted with the actual distribution&amp;rsquo;s update. Now I did take a backup, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite sit well with the now upgraded system and the myriad PHP issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had enough of the band-aid fixes and decided to migrate the nextcloud server to a laptop that was just lying around unused. Decided to stick with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/&#34;&gt;NexcloudPi OS&lt;/a&gt; since it has served me super awesome over the last seven years. I did make sure the auto upgrades were disabled though! Also RSync is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An added  bonus is that I now have a spare RPi3 to tinker with! Not quite &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/14/pico-de-aguila/&#34;&gt;dumbing down&lt;/a&gt;, am I?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The only regret I have from our recent trip to Maui is my zero involvement in any of the trip planning. We could have gone kayaking to see the whales up close. Such a missed opportunity&amp;hellip;Next time I guess!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Setup a basic &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/photos&#34;&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt; page on my website that automatically updates and displays thumbnails from all my posts. Turned out to be a fun mini project and I&amp;rsquo;ve now scratched a long time itch!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some good time up in the air above the Teotihuacán pyramids. Flight was super smooth and with us landing right over a cactus field, the ending was even better!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with S on her first ever Junior ranger activity sitting right above the clouds. The park ranger sneaked in an &amp;rsquo;eating vegetables&amp;rsquo; pact in her oath and handed over a pretty cool wooden badge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Super short hike up to the overlook. Absolutely mesmerized to see the Tradewinds holding down the sea of clouds!&lt;/p&gt;
