&lt;p&gt;S wanted me to read Pinocchio out to her this afternoon. Later this night, right after she brushed her teeth, she innocently asked me if &amp;lsquo;wishing stars&amp;rsquo; were true. I of course, confirmed they did exist and that she had to patiently wait for the magic to come through. Now girl, not everything you read in books is true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long she&amp;rsquo;ll actually believe these things but I do hope to keep this awesome concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/12/26/magic/&#34;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; alive in her as much as I can.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/04/pinocchio/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
