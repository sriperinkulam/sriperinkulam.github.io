      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back from a work trip in Malabo. Got there last Thursday and worked through the weekend. We completed a minor site upgrade and completed almost all of the planned work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to explore any of the island since we were mostly shuttling back and forth from work. From what little I did get to see though, this place is beautiful. Between China&amp;rsquo;s belt and road initiative and the island&amp;rsquo;s oil money from the 90s, Infrastructure looked to be quite top notch. The airport terminal is quite spiffy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food was mediocre at best. The Magno hotel has a decent restaurant. Next time I&amp;rsquo;m here I should probably come over the weekend to explore the cafe&amp;rsquo;s and the boardwalk a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ~230 Ft towering Ceiba tree in the embassy compound is a terrific sight. Apparently this tree is quite prevalent all across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet in the hotel was barely functional - for call&amp;rsquo;s atleast. Looks like some port-blocking was definitely at play. Not having those daily calls back home maybe also made the trip feel a bit longer that it actually was? Need to go better prepared next time!

&lt;p&gt;Spotted right in the same building as the Douala Embassy Branch Office. These folks are goddamn everywhere! There&amp;rsquo;s so little I knew about this firm back in 2015. Three good years doing some real fun work, but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/08/10/for-good-for-now/&#34;&gt;walked out&lt;/a&gt; that April 1st ! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/06/wtw/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back from a seemingly long but super-productive trip to Matamoros/Brownsville. This would be my last TDY while here in Mexico City. We went in body-heavy and it did pay-off. A good bunch of cables were pulled and cameras fixed. The weather was impeccable. With gusty winds, super dark and bearing clouds and temperatures barely hitting the 50s - It was perfect outdoor work weather. More so high up on an extended ladder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to meet the Candadai&amp;rsquo;s the day I landed. They own a property right by a beautiful irrigation canal and this place reminded me of the serene back-waters in Kerala. I totally see myself retiring in a place like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;rsquo;s offer got rescinded because of the hiring freeze. Super bummed but I guess the writing was on the wall. Well, at least there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more clarity now and we can plan our home leave together. The new administration is pushing quite a changes. I&amp;rsquo;m all for productivity and efficiency but I don&amp;rsquo;t quite think they really see or understand the scope of what they&amp;rsquo;re pushing out. With direct impacts, for now it&amp;rsquo;s a wait and act game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Matamoros TDY done, I can now shift gears at work and throttle up the check-out procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone added &lt;em&gt;Cliffs of Dover&lt;/em&gt; to the Barnyard Burger&amp;rsquo;s Jukebox. Been years that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this song! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/31/matamoros/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make it to Houston during S&amp;rsquo; Christmas break, because we very well knew we might not come here during our home leave. Oh boy, what a trip this has been in terms of travel snafus! On our way there we got routed to San Antonio and got grounded for a couple hours because of inclement weather en-route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/houston.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we thought we missed our connection in Dallas because of a delayed departure from Houston, and re-booked for a later flight from Dallas. However, our connecting flight was delayed too and when I checked at the counter in Dallas if we could get switched back to our previous booking, the attendant said that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible. M however was adamant and worked her magic. Looks like they had a &amp;lsquo;weight restriction&amp;rsquo; on the flight and M was able to convince them to flip back our reservations since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip otherwise was pretty uneventful. Some good time with family, speckled with delicious home cooked food and some oh-so-okay outside food. Also note-to-self to make these trips shorter to just about two nights instead of week-long.&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/05/houston-calling/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided not to drive to GDL for Carlos&amp;rsquo; wedding. Just not comfortable driving the GV until we get it properly serviced. Thankfully, we got a flight last minute and we head straight to the GDL zoo after landing. S has been wanting to see the penguins there for quite sometime now and what better opportunity than this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zoo was immaculately maintained! And with the Sky-cables and trains, this was such a great experience. We checked in at the AC hotel for some short down time and then head to an Arabic restaurant for some pretty delicious wraps because we were quite certain M wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything vegetarian at the wedding. The wedding per se was super intimate with about 30 guests. I am glad we were able to fit this in despite a pretty packed end of the year. We head back to the hotel around 1145 just about when S was nearing her &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m done&lt;/em&gt; limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/carlos_gdl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we head to the vegan restaurant that M had scouted for a quick breakfast and get to the GDL airport just in time for the flight back to CDMX.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;V+D were visiting us for a few days around Christmas this year. With the 24th declared a holiday, M suggested we go glamping in Estacas for a night. S loved the idea and we booked two tents for the five of us. Cost was super reasonable given it included breakfast and entry to the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/estacas.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only got to Estacas around 1400 on 24th evening thanks to the four hours we lost to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/&#34;&gt;brake fade on the Grand Vitara&lt;/a&gt;. After a quick check-in, we decide to rent a kayak and row down the stream. I hop off the kayak and swim upstream. S was bent on going to the kids pool alone and not getting into the spring. After about an hour, S &amp;amp; I head to the kids pool. She spends maybe 30 mins in there and calls it a day. Her only ask was that we have dinner by the spring, which we gladly agree to since that&amp;rsquo;s the only restaurant that was open. After dinner, S was sleepy but still super excited about spending the night in the tent. Happy kid, Happy camper! She sleeps through the night despite all the Christmas fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/shas_estacas.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wake up to a super crisp and nippy 25th morning. V and I decide to snorkel/swim in the warm 23C spring water. We spot some sleeping turtles and a great many schools of fish feasting on their morning find. After a simple yet delicious breakfast we make our way back to CDMX. Probably one of our best stays in Estacas so far and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we decided to glamp! Though S didn&amp;rsquo;t get into the spring, she absolutely enjoyed our trip. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/las-estacas/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/GrandVitaraCuernavaca.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downhill and no brakes, what fun! Definitely not at that moment though. Somewhere near Cuernavaca, The Grand Vitara had a brake fade &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this morning on our way to Las Estacas. The brakes would just not work and it felt like I had to pump it to get even a bit of traction.  Got  super close to hitting the car in front of us but thankfully, I found a small lane (ditch?) to veer off from the traffic and engine braked it to a stop. Super lucky none of us were hurt and we were able to veer away from traffic just in time. Also lucky that this happened just about 100m from a mechanic shop! What are the odds? Took them about three hours to do a &lt;del&gt;thorough&lt;/del&gt; check on all four wheels and fix the oil reservoir tray - which they broke while jacking the car up. Oh boy, what a start to this years&amp;rsquo; Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after we were able to get the vehicle to a stop, M asked if it was the floor mat that was the culprit. Nope - I&amp;rsquo;d removed them a few days after we bought this car. All thanks to another &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/&#34;&gt;dreadful experience&lt;/a&gt; several years ago in the Grand Cherokee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignorance and oversight only make sense in hindsight.  About fifteen minutes before this incident,  I did notice the brakes feeling soft and remember thinking - that&amp;rsquo;s odd the brakes worked just fine so far. Also maybe I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice the smoke from the tires because we were driving through quasi dirt roads? All signs of the brakes giving in - had I known about brake fade then. Wee bit wiser now I guess? &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently that is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_fade&#34;&gt;technical term&lt;/a&gt; for a failed brake.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<p>Downhill and no brakes, what fun! Definitely not at that moment though. Somewhere near Cuernavaca, The Grand Vitara had a brake fade <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> this morning on our way to Las Estacas. The brakes would just not work and it felt like I had to pump it to get even a bit of traction.  Got  super close to hitting the car in front of us but thankfully, I found a small lane (ditch?) to veer off from the traffic and engine braked it to a stop. Super lucky none of us were hurt and we were able to veer away from traffic just in time. Also lucky that this happened just about 100m from a mechanic shop! What are the odds? Took them about three hours to do a <del>thorough</del> check on all four wheels and fix the oil reservoir tray - which they broke while jacking the car up. Oh boy, what a start to this years&rsquo; Christmas!</p>
<p>Immediately after we were able to get the vehicle to a stop, M asked if it was the floor mat that was the culprit. Nope - I&rsquo;d removed them a few days after we bought this car. All thanks to another <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/">dreadful experience</a> several years ago in the Grand Cherokee.</p>
<p>Ignorance and oversight only make sense in hindsight.  About fifteen minutes before this incident,  I did notice the brakes feeling soft and remember thinking - that&rsquo;s odd the brakes worked just fine so far. Also maybe I didn&rsquo;t notice the smoke from the tires because we were driving through quasi dirt roads? All signs of the brakes giving in - had I known about brake fade then. Wee bit wiser now I guess? <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/" style="text-decoration: none !important;">ðŸ”—</a>

<p>Apparently that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_fade">technical term</a> for a failed brake.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
