      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sneaked in a day at Liberty at the very end of the skiing season. Was so totally worth it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meena didn&amp;rsquo;t get around taking the slopes since Shasta was pretty much tethered to her. Kids and I had a blast! Last time we were here [Dec 2017] I barely made it down the hill. This time around, I followed Nik&amp;rsquo;s strategy of letting gravity do it&amp;rsquo;s job and maneuvering only when I had to. Totally see how this could be addictive!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
