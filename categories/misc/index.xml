      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reorganized my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/07/migrating-over-to-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;Trilium Notes&lt;/a&gt; a bit. Over time I started dumping notes in there and somewhere it all went a bit wayward. I really need to start using it as a proper knowledge base. The good thing is &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; content that I refer to frequently is all in there. This along with my Signal &amp;lsquo;Note-to-self&amp;rsquo; are my go-to spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to read more blogs that are not tech related. Mostly driven by my curiosity in the tech space, I&amp;rsquo;ve somehow gotten into this bubble of tech-adjacent blogs. Would be nice to pop out a bit. Maybe I should explore &lt;a href=&#34;https://powrss.com/&#34;&gt;powRSS&lt;/a&gt; a bit? I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed I lean towards people who have their own personal domain. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of some sort of commitment towards actually owning their writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking if I want to get a nice digital sketch book. Or I should just re-purpose that old kindle? There are times I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to &amp;lsquo;write&amp;rsquo;. Some things are probably better just sketched out. I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.secuso.privacyfriendlysketching/&#34;&gt;Sketches&lt;/a&gt;
app before. Maybe i&amp;rsquo;ll just port that over to the kindle one of these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google seems to be making all moves to prevent sideloading apps in Android. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time I shift gears and look at other alternatives out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zen-browser.app/&#34;&gt;Zen browser&lt;/a&gt; looks real neat. Should give it a spin one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a mildly thawed frozen Papaya&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/29/all-over-the-place/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S celebrated her 6th today.  Unicorn themed - of course - and had her first and probably last ever PiÃ±ata. But for a mega meltdown initially she did great all through the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we signed up for a Diwali party organized by the Indian Association in Mexico. Primarily on a whim and maybe for the food? The event was last evening and boy, it was a terrible disappointment! It started late as expected. And obnoxiously loud for no reason. Not quite sure if it was the acoustics at the venue or just the MC shouting into the mic.  Maybe both? I love some good rock and metal. I love some good loud music. But I guess not all loud is the same. Also, this day and age, who even does a looping slideshow of pictures of people organizing the event? Dinner was supposed to be served by 1900. Servers said they had orders to serve only at 2030. Maybe the organizers wanted the food to be served only after the main event? When we rechecked at 2030, they said it was pushed to 2130. Had enough of it and walked out.  People were still on the dance floor and there was a good turn out. I guess this kinda boisterous social mayhem is just not my jam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head out to a Japanese (?) restaurant in Polanco since Nimi&amp;rsquo;s, Mei Mei and Manaw were all closed for service. Sushi was &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;. S did great all through the evening though despite the loud music and the crowd. That &amp;lsquo;Sticker by number&amp;rsquo; book that she received as a gift from Maddy kept her fully occupied!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning here and S is off for school. She was mildly upset that I get to stay at home while she needs to go to school. Fair world logic, I guess. We drop her and get to spend a couple hours together watching &lt;em&gt;Spenser Confidential&lt;/em&gt;. Enjoyed it all the more because we recognized quite a few locations where the movie was shot. M&amp;rsquo;s got some brunch out with the ladies in a bit and then a couple more hours before I need to pick up S. Maybe I should tweak that 3D printer?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few things I&amp;rsquo;d really like to dumb down or sort out over the next few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site&lt;/strong&gt;: This site runs on WordPress, has facets of the indieweb, has ActivityPub and a crude implementation of self engineered micropost interface. All cool but needs quite a trim to make the best use of all these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware/Infra&lt;/strong&gt;: VPS, VPN, Odroid for reverse proxy, NCP, NUC, Moose, External hard disks&amp;hellip;Love the current implementation for the various utilities they serve. However, I see myself spending lesser and lesser time in front of the PC. Which is good? But which also means I need to find a better way to manage these in the little time I want to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPX&lt;/strong&gt;: Go on a hike or ride? Automatically log this on my site. Gotta have that super neat Stamen map. I did get really close to setting this up &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/09/garmin-plugin-2/&#34;&gt;sometime back&lt;/a&gt; but got left on the wayside. Also time to update my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin-stats/&#34;&gt;Outdoors plugin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firefly3&lt;/strong&gt;: Love this tool for finance tracking. Need to build that rule engine to automate some of those imports and reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snikket/Matrix/Slidge&lt;/strong&gt;: Need to get this sorted out to be part of those groups that still rely on WhatsApp. I setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/20/bridged/&#34;&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; sometime back but deleted it because I was rarely using it. More of a nice-to-have so may not quite get to this anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memories&lt;/strong&gt;: Selective photo sharing with family or friends. Send a link instead of sharing photos individually. Love the nextcloud setup so far. Would be neat if I can take this up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;: Kinda like my current Navidrome setup. Would like a bit more flexibility in terms of song or folder access though. Smarter playlists? Also multidevice sync? Music system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes Sync&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently relying on Signal notes to self and Trilium send for bookmarks. Need to automate this for self sorting with tags in Trilium notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart sceen&lt;/strong&gt;: On demand and power efficient display for Calendars, Adana, Gallery, dashboard display, news updates etc. Thinking MagicMirror but a bit more optimized. Repurpose that RPi or Odroid once it&amp;rsquo;s all integrated into the NUC?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple weeks, a colleague and I have been trying to clean up the cable mismanagement behind our racks. To work on the equipment you&amp;rsquo;re literally standing on about 1 feet of coiled cable mess. This issue has probably been there over the last several years and nobody has paid much attention to it. Likely because it does not affect the actual functioning of the equipment? And also, this is painstakingly unrewarding work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single day we&amp;rsquo;ve been behind those racks, we keep thinking - why would someone leave so much of surplus cable and more importantly leave it so disorganized? I believe the reasons are multi-fold. Experience (or lack thereof), workmanship issues, time constraints, personnel turnovers and culmination of several unintentional judgement calls is what comes to mind. And then it also strikes me that I&amp;rsquo;m probably making a heavy judgement without having exposure to the situation my predecessors were dealing with? There was probably a solid reason why they had left so much slack in the cable. We will never know. Ultimately we&amp;rsquo;re here and we&amp;rsquo;re working on this â€˜messâ€™. A few years down the lane my successors would probably think why the cables were so short and didn&amp;rsquo;t have much surplus. I guess you just take a call on what&amp;rsquo;s right at this moment and hope it works for the next few yearsâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In work environments where there&amp;rsquo;s heavy turnover - either because of the nature of the job or because of the team dynamics, how do you set the bar for quality workmanship?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With quite a few things constantly evolving over the last several months, I haven&amp;rsquo;t actively paid much attention to this space. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/micro/&#34;&gt;micro posts&lt;/a&gt; now and then, but nowhere close to chronicling things as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to. This is a quick run down of a few things occupying my mind space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about four months since we moved to Mexico City. We absolutely love it here. People are terrific, weather is just right, and this city&amp;rsquo;s got a dash of almost every city we&amp;rsquo;ve lived in so far! M&amp;amp;S have been able to explore the regular tourist spots thanks to the CLO trips. I&amp;rsquo;ve joined them for a few, but what I really enjoy is just experiencing the city for what it&amp;rsquo;s got to offer - And there&amp;rsquo;s no dearth to that. Absolutely blown away by the city planning and the presence of so many parks. The city is spectacularly clean for the number of people living here. Every Sunday one of the main avenues is closed out to vehicular traffic and opened out to runners, cyclists and essentially anybody who wants to enjoy the roads. Amazed at the resources that the local government is able to draw from to sustain this every single weekend! We haven&amp;rsquo;t been that lucky to find decent vegetarian food here. Most local restaurants offer some form of meat in almost all dishes and the vegetarian items are rarely tasty. Dining out definitely leaves a lot to be desired - unless of course you try out other cuisines. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s good food out there - yet to find it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exactly a year since I took on the current position. Best career move I&amp;rsquo;ve made so far, and I absolutely love every part of my job. There&amp;rsquo;s not one day that&amp;rsquo;s akin to another and I&amp;rsquo;m constantly learning every day. Most days just whizz by with constant troubleshooting on systems and processes. I&amp;rsquo;m barely at my desk for an hour a day. Tracing power and logic is so refreshing - The adrenaline rush that comes when you&amp;rsquo;ve found that nuanced fault in the system is addictive. The closest I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to this in the past was while writing code for enhancing functionality in one of my side projects. Ironic that it took me fifteen years to realize what I&amp;rsquo;m really good at - fixing things! And now I get paid to play with toys and travel the world. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to travel to Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo and Hermosillo so far. These cities are so different from CDMX and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I get a chance to experience these regions of the country too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been biking to work most days and doing the Reforma ride on the weekends. So good to be back on the saddle so regularly. Met a couple folks from a trail running group here last weekend and would love to join them whenever time permits. Over the next few months I would also like to visit the National parks around the city. Not having a car is kinda limiting but definitely not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a family, we&amp;rsquo;ve really gotten into playing Zelda - Breath of the Wild. We each have our own profiles and are at different stages of the game. This is fascinating, engaging and such a good way to spend time together while indoors. S enjoys the challenges and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see how good she&amp;rsquo;s gotten at the game. Definitely getting the Tears of the Kingdom really soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been actively tinkering with my home-lab. Mostly doing the bare essentials to keep it updated and running. I&amp;rsquo;ve started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firefly-iii.org/&#34;&gt;FireFly III&lt;/a&gt; more actively to keep track of our expenses and for general budgeting. Since internet and power are decently reliable, I should probably move part of my home-lab over from MD to here.&lt;/p&gt;

I&rsquo;ve had a chance to travel to Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo and Hermosillo so far. These cities are so different from CDMX and I&rsquo;m glad I get a chance to experience these regions of the country too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been biking to work most days and doing the Reforma ride on the weekends. So good to be back on the saddle so regularly. Met a couple folks from a trail running group here last weekend and would love to join them whenever time permits. Over the next few months I would also like to visit the National parks around the city. Not having a car is kinda limiting but definitely not a big deal.</p>
<p>As a family, we&rsquo;ve really gotten into playing Zelda - Breath of the Wild. We each have our own profiles and are at different stages of the game. This is fascinating, engaging and such a good way to spend time together while indoors. S enjoys the challenges and it&rsquo;s amazing to see how good she&rsquo;s gotten at the game. Definitely getting the Tears of the Kingdom really soon!</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been actively tinkering with my home-lab. Mostly doing the bare essentials to keep it updated and running. I&rsquo;ve started using <a href="https://www.firefly-iii.org/">FireFly III</a> more actively to keep track of our expenses and for general budgeting. Since internet and power are decently reliable, I should probably move part of my home-lab over from MD to here.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/morganhousel&#34;&gt;@Morganhousel&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/61faa02775c029.76416307&#34;&gt;fantastic post yesterday&lt;/a&gt; outlining how each person&amp;rsquo;s trajectory is riddled with â€˜flukesâ€™. Humanity constantly evolves from a quagmire of possibilities and there&amp;rsquo;s very little merit in looking in retrospect. I think the likelihood of a successful forecast can only be enhanced if we work with the factors in the &lt;strong&gt;present&lt;/strong&gt; - not the past, not the future. The past is barely helpful and you&amp;rsquo;d rather not rely on those from the future. (Odd I say that after all those years I spent churning numbers as an actuarial analyst.) Ultimately what trumps is that humans find it really hard to delineate emotions from decision making. As much as you&amp;rsquo;d like to disagree, you see it in every realm - Medicine, Finance, Sports, Academics, Health just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, we had a fascinating &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/&#34;&gt;close call on I-15 S&lt;/a&gt; while heading towards New Haven. (Fascinating because, I learnt it the hard way and everyone who drives a car and has a floor-mat should be aware of this.) Accidents tend to give you that moment for retrospect and back then I jotted something similar to the thoughts I have today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proverbial â€“ â€˜Everything happens for a reasonâ€™ is just not true. I believe the human brain does a wonderful job in assigning a reason to the cause and quite conveniently this is always subtly and retrospectively done. In its quest to find reason, it ends up triggering neural connections that emotionally and logically seem reasonable. So when and how do we draw the line while making choices and how do you substantiate the choices youâ€™ve made? Or is the whole premise that as a logical and emotional machine youâ€™re feeding good and bad data (choices) as a stimulus to train the body to better react to unforeseeable situations in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2010/01/21/gut-instinct-twitter-and-my-career/&#34;&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/08/10/for-good-for-now/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2019/11/23/weeknote-47-shastas-first/&#34;&gt;risky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/10/21/flight-down-south/&#34;&gt;shifts&lt;/a&gt; in my career over the last decade. Most driven by what I felt at that very moment - Gut instinct. Absolutely none that I regret. And most have been very rewarding. So when it comes to making a choice at that critical moment, I try and keep retrospectives at bay. Every once in a while, I do catch myself careening from this golden rule. That&amp;rsquo;s when I take a good pause, stop connecting the dots and look at just that isolated dot at that moment. It&amp;rsquo;s worked wonders before and I trust that streak to continue. Irony being, my previous statement moots everything I said before! What can I say, we&amp;rsquo;re a good bunch of optimistic morons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leave a comment if any of this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. I&amp;rsquo;ll be more than happy to help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to setup a comprehensive and secure â€˜handoverâ€™ document for my family - In case I cease to exist. My key priorities were it should :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be easy to update and maintain when I am alive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be easy to reference and access when I am dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have multiple fall-back points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the most straightforward way to do this would be to have all the information on a secure spreadsheet or document. But that&amp;rsquo;s not fun! So I decided to use Trilium Notes for it. When it&amp;rsquo;s time, my wife has three options to access the support checklist a) Online via a secure portal/app b) Using a secure flash-drive c) Old school printed sheets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Screenshot-from-2021-08-06-15-05-32-1200x600.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is something super easy to replicate. Leaving this out here should someone find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get up and running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.electronjs.org/apps/trilium-notes&#34;&gt;Trilium desktop app from here&lt;/a&gt; and install it on your machine. If it&amp;rsquo;s the first time you are using it, it should prompt you to create a local account. You can sync this with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/04/06/installing-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;server app&lt;/a&gt; later if you need one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On first install, Trilium also installs a demo document. This is super helpful to understand how Trilium works. But for now, collapse the &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Trilium Demo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; folder in the left sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download my Â &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sriperinkulam/closeout/raw/main/Closeout%20Template.zip&#34;&gt;Closeout html&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; template zip file. Right click on the &amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo; folder on the left sidebar and click &amp;lsquo;Import into&amp;rsquo;. Select the zip file you just downloaded and click on &amp;lsquo;Import&amp;rsquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s it! Update the template to your needs and export for backups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining and backups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To encrypt the folder, just right click on Â and select &amp;lsquo;protect subtree&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trilium provides you three modes of export - Zipped HTML, Zipped markdown and OPML. I prefer the HTML export since it can be used in isolation. Do note however that all notes lose their encryption when they&amp;rsquo;re exported out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Trilium notes since it fits into my workflow. You should be able to import the template into any note-taking app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The template is obviously bare minimum and generic. Tweak/add based on your personal situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally kept my guidance instructions and passwords isolated since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be printing them on paper. You could have them all in one place here in Trilium and secure the folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If saving the files/backups on a flash drive, I&amp;rsquo;d strongly recommend you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/11/01/encrypting-drives/&#34;&gt;VeraCrypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a reasonably healthy person with no alarming issues. But hey, you never know! I think it&amp;rsquo;s critical that your family has good guidance on how best to pick up where you left off. Think of this as the last parting gift. It took me about four years of procrastination and few spurts of action to get here. And I am so glad I did. If not anything, it&amp;rsquo;s helping me document these critical pieces in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your life closeout plan?&lt;/p&gt;
