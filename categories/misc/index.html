Iâ€™d like to read more blogs that are not tech related. Mostly driven by my curiosity in the tech space, Iâ€™ve somehow gotten into this bubble of tech-adjacent blogs. Would be nice to pop out a bit. Maybe I should explore powRSS a bit? Iâ€™ve also noticed I lean towards people who have their own personal domain. Maybe itâ€™s a sign of some sort of commitment towards actually owning their writing?

Unicorn themed - of course - and had her first and probably last ever PiÃ±ata. But for a mega meltdown initially she did great all through the event.
A few weeks ago, we signed up for a Diwali party organized by the Indian Association in Mexico. Primarily on a whim and maybe for the food? The event was last evening and boy, it was a terrible disappointment! It started late as expected. And obnoxiously loud for no reason. Not quite sure if it was the acoustics at the venue or just the MC shouting into the mic. Maybe both? I love some good rock and metal. I love some good loud music. But I guess not all loud is the same. Also, this day and age, who even does a looping slideshow of pictures of people organizing the event? Dinner was supposed to be served by 1900. Servers said they had orders to serve only at 2030. Maybe the organizers wanted the food to be served only after the main event? When we rechecked at 2030, they said it was pushed to 2130. Had enough of it and walked out. People were still on the dance floor and there was a good turn out. I guess this kinda boisterous social mayhem is just not my jam?

Site: This site runs on WordPress, has facets of the indieweb, has ActivityPub and a crude implementation of self engineered micropost interface. All cool but needs quite a trim to make the best use of all these features.
Hardware/Infra: VPS, VPN, Odroid for reverse proxy, NCP, NUC, Moose, External hard disksâ€¦Love the current implementation for the various utilities they serve. However, I see myself spending lesser and lesser time in front of the PC. Which is good? But which also means I need to find a better way to manage these in the little time I want to spend.

Likely because it does not affect the actual functioning of the equipment? And also, this is painstakingly unrewarding work.

Iâ€™ve posted a few micro posts now and then, but nowhere close to chronicling things as much as Iâ€™d like to. This is a quick run down of a few things occupying my mind space:
Itâ€™s been about four months since we moved to Mexico City. We absolutely love it here. People are terrific, weather is just right, and this cityâ€™s got a dash of almost every city weâ€™ve lived in so far! M&amp;S have been able to explore the regular tourist spots thanks to the CLO trips. Iâ€™ve joined them for a few, but what I really enjoy is just experiencing the city for what itâ€™s got to offer - And thereâ€™s no dearth to that. Absolutely blown away by the city planning and the presence of so many parks. The city is spectacularly clean for the number of people living here. Every Sunday one of the main avenues is closed out to vehicular traffic and opened out to runners, cyclists and essentially anybody who wants to enjoy the roads. Amazed at the resources that the local government is able to draw from to sustain this every single weekend! We havenâ€™t been that lucky to find decent vegetarian food here. Most local restaurants offer some form of meat in almost all dishes and the vegetarian items are rarely tasty. Dining out definitely leaves a lot to be desired - unless of course you try out other cuisines. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s good food out there - yet to find it though.

Humanity constantly evolves from a quagmire of possibilities and thereâ€™s very little merit in looking in retrospect. I think the likelihood of a successful forecast can only be enhanced if we work with the factors in the present - not the past, not the future. The past is barely helpful and youâ€™d rather not rely on those from the future. (Odd I say that after all those years I spent churning numbers as an actuarial analyst.) Ultimately what trumps is that humans find it really hard to delineate emotions from decision making. As much as youâ€™d like to disagree, you see it in every realm - Medicine, Finance, Sports, Academics, Health just to name a few.

Over the last few years, Iâ€™ve been wanting to setup a comprehensive and secure â€˜handoverâ€™ document for my family - In case I cease to exist. My key priorities were it should :
be easy to update and maintain when I am alive be easy to reference and access when I am dead have multiple fall-back points Now, the most straightforward way to do this would be to have all the information on a secure spreadsheet or document. But thatâ€™s not fun! So I decided to use Trilium Notes for it. When itâ€™s time, my wife has three options to access the support checklist a) Online via a secure portal/app b) Using a secure flash-drive c) Old school printed sheets

Having Shasta probably makes me appreciate this a lot more. Meena and I started taking Shasta out on hikes since she was about 3 weeks old. We expose her to sharp tools and fire under close supervision. I still think thereâ€™s so much more we could do with her once we overcome our fear of exposing her to the elements. And this video was a much needed terrific reminder of how short we were falling on that metric!
