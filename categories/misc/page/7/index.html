My first post was dated March 10th ‘07 and that means It’s been exactly one year that I started rambling on Wordpress. It’s been a wonderful journey all along.
Wordpress has been one beautiful tool to rant and rave at my whims. It gave me the reconfigurability which Blogger didn’t match ( and I believe it still doesn’t !), the flexibility that I could deploy when required, the aesthetic appeal that I wanted to personify on my space, and Oh yes the always responsive support team that I believe none of the other competitors of Wordpress are even close to! Be it the stats page or the widgets corner; the lucid variety of themes or the anti spam Akismet utility, the going’s been fabulous.

And oh yes! It’s the first ever play I’ve watched live :-) .
I’d blocked four tickets on saturday evening for the show but later had to cancel two as Adi and Abhi had to drop out. Though the show was scheduled to start at 3:30 pm , it had to be delayed due to a few technical glitches. In fact it was a wonderful stroke of luck for me :-) . I was caught in a traffic jam at 3:25pm and made it to the theater only around 3:55pm. Suysh had luckily arrived a bit early and purchased the tickets well before I was there!

This month seems to be a bit demanding. I’ve got to pick up on .Net , complete an internal certification and oh yes, there’s the french certification exam too. Besides, I’ve got to avoid sacrificing my personal time come what may. After all , that’s one thing that keeps me motivated :-) .

I rarely watch TV shows. But of late, I’ve been following this particular show called ‘The Idea star singer’ which is screened on Asianet at around 9 pm IST . That’s mainly because, people in my house are hooked on to it and I rarely get to shift channels while having dinner. Initially all that interested me in it was the way various participants portrayed themselves in creative outfits and the various dance steps they choreographed. But of late as the show comes to it’s end, you really get to learn a lot from it.

I’d been to Chennai with a few of my friends from Hyderabad for my convocation last weekend. Though we’d applied for the In-Absentia mode, we thought this was one event we just couldn’t miss. Machi, Adi, Abi and I left on friday evening by the Egmore Exp. MV, Kittu and his cousin Hari joined us at the station. Kranthi and Thopz were supposed to meet us but then had to drop their plans as they’d got their visa for their Masters at Hertfordshire university and had to fly the next day. The train journey was as such pretty boring. We reached Arrakonam at about five in the morning. People started pouring in by around 6:30 am. We managed to get a room in one of the lodges and left for the University at around 11:00 am.
