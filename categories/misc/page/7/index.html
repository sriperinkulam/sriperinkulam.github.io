Quit!</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>I was just sifting through a few of my previous posts couple of minutes back and even before I realized, something came in as a wonderful surprise. My first post was dated March 10th ‘07 and that means It’s been exactly one year that I started rambling on Wordpress. It’s been a wonderful journey all along.
Wordpress has been one beautiful tool to rant and rave at my whims. It gave me the reconfigurability which Blogger didn’t match ( and I believe it still doesn’t !), the flexibility that I could deploy when required, the aesthetic appeal that I wanted to personify on my space, and Oh yes the always responsive support team that I believe none of the other competitors of Wordpress are even close to! Be it the stats page or the widgets corner; the lucid variety of themes or the anti spam Akismet utility, the going’s been fabulous.

Br: Session? What session? Today’s Saturday!

And oh yes! It’s the first ever play I’ve watched live :-) .
I’d blocked four tickets on saturday evening for the show but later had to cancel two as Adi and Abhi had to drop out. Though the show was scheduled to start at 3:30 pm , it had to be delayed due to a few technical glitches. In fact it was a wonderful stroke of luck for me :-) . I was caught in a traffic jam at 3:25pm and made it to the theater only around 3:55pm. Suysh had luckily arrived a bit early and purchased the tickets well before I was there!

It was fine for the first one month, but of late I’ve realized there’s nothing much productive that I’m able to do once I’m back and whatever little I can force myself to, isn’t really helping me.
This month seems to be a bit demanding. I’ve got to pick up on .Net , complete an internal certification and oh yes, there’s the french certification exam too. Besides, I’ve got to avoid sacrificing my personal time come what may. After all , that’s one thing that keeps me motivated :-) .

I rarely watch TV shows. But of late, I’ve been following this particular show called ‘The Idea star singer’ which is screened on Asianet at around 9 pm IST . That’s mainly because, people in my house are hooked on to it and I rarely get to shift channels while having dinner. Initially all that interested me in it was the way various participants portrayed themselves in creative outfits and the various dance steps they choreographed. But of late as the show comes to it’s end, you really get to learn a lot from it.

It makes me wonder at times why it always happens this way. You never even bother to think about them when you have all the time in the world but when they’re right in front of you, you want those moments to just get back to you.
I’d been to Chennai with a few of my friends from Hyderabad for my convocation last weekend. Though we’d applied for the In-Absentia mode, we thought this was one event we just couldn’t miss. Machi, Adi, Abi and I left on friday evening by the Egmore Exp. MV, Kittu and his cousin Hari joined us at the station. Kranthi and Thopz were supposed to meet us but then had to drop their plans as they’d got their visa for their Masters at Hertfordshire university and had to fly the next day. The train journey was as such pretty boring. We reached Arrakonam at about five in the morning. People started pouring in by around 6:30 am. We managed to get a room in one of the lodges and left for the University at around 11:00 am.

I’ve launched another blog in wordpress. But for a change this is something serious. The central idea is to develop an Ad free, simple interface site which could be a one stop site for all the latest happenings in Hyderabad and also serve as a travel guide in the city. I call it the Hyderabad Simplified Online Project (HSOP) :-)
