      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my list of â€˜things to sortâ€™ is a bunch of files and physical documents that we&amp;rsquo;re compelled to move from place to place as we relocate every few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering getting a document scanner to digest these files digitally and get rid of them. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind for a few years now and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve reached that decision threshold to bite the bullet and get a scanner. Now these devices run anywhere between 200 and 600 USD that I am NOT interested in spending for this indulgence. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely hunt for one on ebay or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.backmarket.com/&#34;&gt;backmarket&lt;/a&gt; sticking to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/uses&#34;&gt;recycled hardware whenever feasible&lt;/a&gt; stand. The &lt;em&gt;Fujitsu Fi 6130&lt;/em&gt; seems to fit that &amp;lsquo;cheap and best&amp;rsquo;  bucket if sourced second hand. They seem to be selling for about 70 USD.

&lt;p&gt;Setup these three &lt;a href=&#34;https://meshtastic.org/&#34;&gt;meshtastic&lt;/a&gt; T1000-E radio&amp;rsquo;s today. Amazed at how tiny yet powerful these are. They seem to last for about three days with GPS and telemetry on. Until Meshtastic enables all the sensors I might probably box these up. In a pinch these can always be used for mesh&amp;rsquo;d comms if needed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/26/meshtastic/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just struck me that most of my disk drives are quite old. Almost all of them were salvaged from old laptops. Age does not necessarily equate to performance and I do have decent backups, but only a question of time before I see them going kaput. Living vicariously on the edge when it comes to self-hosting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bought a desk organizer a few weeks ago to arrange all my micro systems. The NUC, RPi NCP, Odroid and routers all now sit neatly in one space. The sliding shelves are an added bonus and the open back and sides give a lot of space for air circulation and cable management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple weeks, a colleague and I have been trying to clean up the cable mismanagement behind our racks. To work on the equipment you&amp;rsquo;re literally standing on about 1 feet of coiled cable mess. This issue has probably been there over the last several years and nobody has paid much attention to it. Likely because it does not affect the actual functioning of the equipment? And also, this is painstakingly unrewarding work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single day we&amp;rsquo;ve been behind those racks, we keep thinking - why would someone leave so much of surplus cable and more importantly leave it so disorganized? I believe the reasons are multi-fold. Experience (or lack thereof), workmanship issues, time constraints, personnel turnovers and culmination of several unintentional judgement calls is what comes to mind. And then it also strikes me that I&amp;rsquo;m probably making a heavy judgement without having exposure to the situation my predecessors were dealing with? There was probably a solid reason why they had left so much slack in the cable. We will never know. Ultimately we&amp;rsquo;re here and we&amp;rsquo;re working on this â€˜messâ€™. A few years down the lane my successors would probably think why the cables were so short and didn&amp;rsquo;t have much surplus. I guess you just take a call on what&amp;rsquo;s right at this moment and hope it works for the next few yearsâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In work environments where there&amp;rsquo;s heavy turnover - either because of the nature of the job or because of the team dynamics, how do you set the bar for quality workmanship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of late, the NUC has been getting really hot. Core CPU temperatures were hitting the 80s despite the system being on literally no load. When I first bought it in mid-2020, I was aware that this lineage of tiny monsters were known for their &amp;lsquo;hot&amp;rsquo;ness and the fan being a bit loud.Â  Only over the last few months have I really seen this sudden spike in temperatures though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first obvious step was to get rid of the plastic lid and get those aluminum heat-sinks. That helped a bit until yesterday when the temps shot to the 90s for no reason. A quick &lt;strong&gt;htop&lt;/strong&gt; run didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to show any processes that were hogging resources. Troubleshooting this a bit further, I figured I did run some apt updates a few days back that triggered Kernel updates. I might now have to get into the BIOS and see if any firmware updates are pending. As luck might have it though, the current keyboard that I have functions via Bluetooth only and I can&amp;rsquo;t quite use it to get into the BIOS. I do have an alternate keyboard, again Bluetooth but this one comes with a USB receiver - which I conveniently left in my tech black-box in MD! ðŸ¤¦ Really hope M doesn&amp;rsquo;t forget bringing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I installed the &lt;strong&gt;cpupower-gui&lt;/strong&gt; tool and set the Governor to &amp;lsquo;powersave&amp;rsquo; mode. Does seem to have done the trick for now. I might have to open up the unit and see if it needs some deep cleaning with some compressed air. Sometime soon I guess!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bi-yearly rundown on the state of the home-servers I run and applications I host on the cloud.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Published while listening to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=zkvNnRjIhPE&#34;&gt;Mist of Capricorn ( Manavyalakincharadate ) | Agam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/wireguard-2.drawio.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few major changes since the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/09/07/state-of-the-networks-sep-2021/&#34;&gt;last September update&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the Jan trip, I moved the Odroid XU4 and NCP over to MD. Thanks to WireGuard, I can still access these remotely super seamlessly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brought in the RPi4 NC to the same WireGuard network. Lesser maintenance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not quite using the Navidrome and Calibre-web setup as much. Definitely nice to have though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a couple &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/20/bridged/&#34;&gt;Matrix Bridges&lt;/a&gt;. Ansible is pretty awesome! Need to front the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/25/snikket/&#34;&gt;Snikket instance&lt;/a&gt; I setup in Jan when I have the mind-space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m liking Caddy better than Traefik!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next few months, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably focus a bit more on SSH hardening, implement more robust Firewalls and automating the backups.&lt;/p&gt;
