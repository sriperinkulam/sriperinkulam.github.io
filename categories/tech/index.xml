      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immich is pretty neat! It does hog /need a decent machine to run though. I briefly dabbled  installing it on an RPi3 a year ago and figured the juice wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the squeeze for what I was looking at. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty content with having all my media on a Nextcloud server where rest of my files reside. This seven year old repurposed laptop on which NC runs In tandem with Tailscale and a digital frame, serves most of my needs for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also love that subtle clink you have going on in the comment form! Pretty crafty! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/immich/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week in Malabo, I discovered that none of my self-hosted services were working. Initially, I thought it was due to my home internet connection. However, upon returning last night, I realized that wasnâ€™t the case at all. My tiny reverse proxy, Caddy, had encountered an issue during an automated security upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve adopted a hands-off approach to self-hosting, setting up auto-updates for all my services. I only intervene when something breaks. Today, I decided to give my setup a little TLC, upgrading my passthrough VPS and Odroid XU4 to Bookworm. Remarkably, the process took less than 30 minutes! Thanks to Docker and Tailscale, everything connects seamlessly and just works. Love it! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/caddy-not-caddying/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my list of â€˜things to sortâ€™ is a bunch of files and physical documents that we&amp;rsquo;re compelled to move from place to place as we relocate every few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering getting a document scanner to digest these files digitally and get rid of them. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind for a few years now and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve reached that decision threshold to bite the bullet and get a scanner. Now these devices run anywhere between 200 and 600 USD that I am NOT interested in spending for this indulgence. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely hunt for one on ebay or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.backmarket.com/&#34;&gt;backmarket&lt;/a&gt; sticking to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/uses&#34;&gt;recycled hardware whenever feasible&lt;/a&gt; stand. The &lt;em&gt;Fujitsu Fi 6130&lt;/em&gt; seems to fit that &amp;lsquo;cheap and best&amp;rsquo;  bucket if sourced second hand. They seem to be selling for about 70 USD.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup these three &lt;a href=&#34;https://meshtastic.org/&#34;&gt;meshtastic&lt;/a&gt; T1000-E radio&amp;rsquo;s today. Amazed at how tiny yet powerful these are. They seem to last for about three days with GPS and telemetry on. Until Meshtastic enables all the sensors I might probably box these up. In a pinch these can always be used for mesh&amp;rsquo;d comms if needed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/26/meshtastic/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around 0300 today, I was woken up rudely to a blaring sound. For a moment I assumed it was from the Seismic City alert system that CDMX has. Turned out, it was from the old blue dell laptop that I currently use to run NextcloudPi. For some reason, looks like it rebooted and went into a huge panic mode because it lost time sync. Yanked all the cables and shut it down. Something to figure out over the next few days when I have time. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/13/blue-dell-alert/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just struck me that most of my disk drives are quite old. Almost all of them were salvaged from old laptops. Age does not necessarily equate to performance and I do have decent backups, but only a question of time before I see them going kaput. Living vicariously on the edge when it comes to self-hosting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bought a desk organizer a few weeks ago to arrange all my micro systems. The NUC, RPi NCP, Odroid and routers all now sit neatly in one space. The sliding shelves are an added bonus and the open back and sides give a lot of space for air circulation and cable management.&lt;/p&gt;
