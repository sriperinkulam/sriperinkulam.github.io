      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not quite sure when or where I came across this open book - &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.worksinprogress.co/book/maintenance-of-everything/the-maintenance-race/the-maintenance-race/7&#34;&gt;Maintenance: of everything&lt;/a&gt;. Fascinating read so far and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did save it in my quick notes whenever I did! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/02/maintenance-of-everything/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the &amp;lsquo;Why&amp;rsquo; rather than the &amp;lsquo;Who&amp;rsquo; when doing a postmortem of an incident - Such a nuanced yet pivotal shift!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last month, I seem to have switched into a better reading rhythm. I&amp;rsquo;d probably attribute it to having a bit more time and mind-space for myself. Also, I figured I needed a better system to keep track of the books I had in queue.Â  While Wallabag has been a terrific tool to assimilate, read and archive articles that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across online; I badly needed one for books too. Last month, I set a bare-bones system in my note-taking tool and this seems to do the trick for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Book-Notes.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a goal as such for this year. I do however want to get to these books that I have in my reading queue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting point on M1 and M2 [Measures of money]. With the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.allsides.com/story/biden-signs-19-trillion-covid-19-relief-bill-law&#34;&gt;signing of the 1.9T$ bill today&lt;/a&gt; in the US, we&amp;rsquo;ve essentially created 6T$ over the last 10 months. Just like that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid19 has broughtÂ  unprecedented suffering to many. Deaths, Unemployment, Medical complications, lifestyle changes, Social unrest and several other ramifications which we are yet to experience. If anything, it has taught us highlighted how abysmally poor we are in collectively addressing pressing issues. It has also shown us that when disaster strikes, we only take care of our own and we are selectively biased even at that. Nature gave us yet another opportunity to show how we could better ourselves and elevate us to the next stage of evolution and we miserably failed. With our myopic non-collaborative actions, pushing politics and power over general good, we&amp;rsquo;ve defined a new low. Mileage on isolated or individual efforts unfortunately does not carry the ripple effect that can scale. Nothing surprising there - Humans are selfish creatures. We of course needed something to balance all the &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt; and cognitive advances we supposedly have over other living things. Humanity rests is constant chaos and Covid19 was continues to fuel that chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a digression, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunita Narain, 56, is perhaps India&amp;rsquo;s most well-known environmental activist. The director of a small but influential Delhi-based NGO called the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), she has been included on Timeâ€™s list of 100 Most Influential People; last year, Leonardo DiCaprio chose to interview her for his climate change-themed documentary Before the Flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re building a zoo disaster plan, there&amp;rsquo;s one thing to keep in mind: Murphy&amp;rsquo;s law. Anything that could go wrong, will. Just ask the flock of flamingos that weathered Hurricane Andrew in a public restroom at Zoo Miami in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adding Night of the Grizzlies to my reading list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just read: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/deadly-grizzly-bear-attacks-changed-national-park-service-forever-180964462/&#34;&gt;The Deadly Grizzly Bear Attacks That Changed the National Park Service Forever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glacier National Parkâ€™s busiest season came to an abrupt halt in the summer of 1967. In a matter of hours, two grizzly bears had acted as they never had before in the parkâ€™s 57-year history. Several miles apart, each bear had mauled a young woman on the same day, in the dark, early hours of August 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
