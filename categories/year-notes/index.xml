&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jan&#34;&gt;JAN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiked up Izta via &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/01/28/la-joya-izta-volcan-hike/&#34;&gt;La Joya&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick work trip to Monterrey. Loved that those hills are right there in the city! Next time I&amp;rsquo;m back here, I should plan to get here around a weekend. Food was great. Traffic was meh. Would strongly consider bidding for a position here - if/when one opens up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M,S &amp;amp; S went to Oaxaca. They loved it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feb&#34;&gt;FEB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work travels took me to Merida and Managua. Managua had the vibes of any second tier southern Indian city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anton&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/02/05/prieto-y-prieta/&#34;&gt;Whiskey tasting&lt;/a&gt; was uber fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Girl scouts hike to Desierto Leones. Mike led the group. Was good to take a step back and be just a regular participant!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piedra Herrada Monarch butterfly trip. Barely got to spot any Monarchs. Looks like they made their way up north a bit sooner this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mar&#34;&gt;MAR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aparna and Vuday visit us for a few days. Joined them on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/04/globo-aerost%C3%A1tico/&#34;&gt;hot air balloon up the Teotihuacan Pyramids&lt;/a&gt;. Such a cool experience!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in Managua for a longish trip. Those wire pulls were painful but so much fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M &amp;amp; S went to Las Estacas for the Girl Scouts Camping trip. Missed being there with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We took our R&amp;amp;R in Maui for about a week. So much fun being in the water! But boy, oh so pricey! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/03/leleiwi-overlook-trail/&#34;&gt;Haleakala&lt;/a&gt; was neat. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/06/maui-whales/&#34;&gt;Missed the whales&lt;/a&gt; though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;apr&#34;&gt;APR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/12/izta-attempt/&#34;&gt;Hallucinations up on the Izta&lt;/a&gt; were surreal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family visited Cancun. We took a rain-check. Just didn&amp;rsquo;t make financial sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jothi patti and the Wierer&amp;rsquo;s visited us for a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/23/nevado-de-toluca/&#34;&gt;Nevado de toluca&lt;/a&gt; hike would probably be one of the highlights of our Mexico posting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiked up &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/14/pico-de-%C3%A1guila/&#34;&gt;Pico de aguila cerro cruz&lt;/a&gt;. The descent was - oh so painful - but super fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work trip to Hermosillo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may&#34;&gt;MAY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet another epic Bourbon tasting evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M took a salsa making class and she said she loved it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quick whirlwind trip to NJ, NY, MD for Rohita&amp;rsquo;s wedding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S went for a weeklong &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/05/18/pipiol/&#34;&gt;school trip to Pipiol&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;d see the effects of it over the next few weeks&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed to fit in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/05/17/nextcloudpi/&#34;&gt;NextcloudPi migration&lt;/a&gt; and setup the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/05/23/digital-photo-frame/&#34;&gt;Digital Frame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work took me back to Monterrey for a short project and then to Merida for a routine visit. Good bunch of travel this month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jun&#34;&gt;JUN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appa, Manni and Miss Bama whip out a super successful India trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M,S and I went to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/06/03/bmg/&#34;&gt;Blue Man Group performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jinesh &amp;amp; Soony visit us in CDMX for a few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tinkered a bit with &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/06/08/tasmota/&#34;&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt; and HomeAssistant to setup a few smart-plugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freehold fly visit us for a couple weeks. Kids were amazing but boy, it was one loud household!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jul&#34;&gt;JUL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M&amp;amp;S visit New Braunfels and spend a week with the Hancocks. Absolutely floored by the Schlitterbahn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M takes a PLP trip to Hidalgo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet another work trip to Merida.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aug&#34;&gt;AUG&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A&amp;amp;A move in to their new house!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work travel to Hermosillo for the NCC move. Super productive but tiring couple weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M&amp;amp;S come visit me in HMO over one of the weekends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wierer&amp;rsquo;s visit CDMX for another short visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daphne&amp;rsquo;s and WhiteBagley&amp;rsquo;s visit us for a few weeks. We make it to Nevado de Toluca for a short hike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/09/18/moving/&#34;&gt;Hermosillo trip&lt;/a&gt; continues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M goes to Vancouver for the girls&amp;rsquo; trip. S&amp;amp;I have a good three nights by ourselves. S does pretty good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/09/28/woken/&#34;&gt;CDMX monsoon&lt;/a&gt; is in full swing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I take the bike out for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/10/26/dia-de-muertos-ride/&#34;&gt;Dia de muerto&lt;/a&gt; bike ride&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Back to Matamoros for a long standing project. A mild &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/10/14/mat-notes/&#34;&gt;cartel scare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/10/29/crisp-new-start/&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; goes kaput. Migrated this portal to Hugo after dabbling around a bit.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With quite a few developments on the personal front, the last few months has kept me quite &amp;lsquo;busy&amp;rsquo;. Despite Covid, I did a bunch of travel which is always nice! Last August, Appa kinda lost his patience and wanted to make a trip to India. We figured September was the most optimal time and I flew over to MD to accompany him back. With just a day off work, I was able to finagle a whirlwind weekend trip to the US and back. M and S head over to the states in October to be a bit of a help in MD while I looked after two grand old men here in India. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I&amp;rsquo;ve done this and but for a few rough days, I loved spending time helping them accomplish what they wanted to over the course of three months. Appa was able to get most of his &amp;lsquo;admin&amp;rsquo; stuff done and more importantly got to spend time with his younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December I made a quick trip to Delhi to meet folks at work. Was good catching up after all of these months of telework! Mid December and just before the Omicron wave hit the Asian region, we were asked to report into work on premises. Obviously made sense to take Appa back to MD since we didn&amp;rsquo;t want him to be living alone - more so when we started seeing the Omicron effect in the US, Israel and UK. I accompanied him back on the 31st and used this opportunity to also take some time off to spend with M &amp;amp; S! It was a much needed break and we did get to do a bunch of stuff in the short time that I was there: Got the Moderna booster - In tandem with Jet-lag, the next day fatigue was a killer, Went on a nice date with M to a Thai restaurant - but for the jasmine spray hand sanitizer..UGH!, Took S our for &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/01/trolley-trail/&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/05/patapsco-thru-trail/&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/06/oregon-ridge-park/&#34;&gt;hikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/05/january-6-2022-0609/&#34;&gt;Built a scooter&lt;/a&gt; for S, Migrated my servers over to MD, packed my belongings in all of 65lbs and moved to Delhi. The return leg was quite happening with American transferring my booking to BA and transiting  me via Heathrow. Called for a lot of last minute Covid digital paperwork. Thank goodness to smartphones and free WiFi access in Airports!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I&amp;rsquo;m super excited to be in Delhi! Still too many variables at play and oddly that seems to be the constant in our lives. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to explore this fascinating city and then head further up north during the weekends. Omicron is going to hugely shape the next few months and I&amp;rsquo;m going to make best use of the wrenches it&amp;rsquo;s gonna throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy (Belated) New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/12/28/sea-la-vie/&#34;&gt;muted attempt last year&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to ring in 2021 with an early morning Surfing class at Covelong. The girls loved it and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have asked for a better start. Exhilarating, to say the least. And oh, salt water does BURN your eyes!&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/20210102_040028-1200x675.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shasta enjoyed her time on the beach with her grand-parents. Dainty princess that she is, she apparently had her shoes on - for the whole two hours. Nevertheless she did enjoy the early breezy morning, watching us fall umpteen number of times. When asked later, she did mention she thought we were exercising. We&amp;rsquo;ll go with that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 was obviously a rough year for many. I&amp;rsquo;m extremely fortunate and thankful that C-19 had minimal impact on us and our extended family. Hoping that this &amp;rsquo;new&amp;rsquo; year brings in closure on many fronts and at the very least gives us resilience to rebound stronger. Here&amp;rsquo;s to riding those waves and taking time to connect with others during those lulls. Happy 2021!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convincing their parents last minute, Divyaa and Raaghuv drove up to Maryland with us. The kids had a ball of a time in the last row of the Sienna. We stopped over at Durham for the night and met Uncle Lou the next day for breakfast. Of course also visited Fuqua school of Business. Rajesh graduated from here and we so wished he was alive to show us around this campus. A gentle reminder to check-in with everyone near and dear every once in a while&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meena and I took the kids Skiing at Liberty on Thursday night. This has become more of a tradition now at year-end(beginning). A first for Raaghuv and Divyaa though. Just before we left, the boys decided to take on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libertymountainresort.com/interactive-map#close&#34;&gt;Lower blue streak&lt;/a&gt;, and I joined them. Absolutely reminded me of my first day at skiing! Need to work on that nuanced braking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and of course, Happy New Year! Last year I chose to be a bit more free, a privilege I am so glad I had and thankful for. Looking forward to what we chart in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2014/12/31/2014-highlights/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took some time out today to make sure I post a year-end update for 2014. I somehow seem to have missed doing this for the past three years.  Looking back, this year has been extremely fulfilling - both professionally and personally. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick rewind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interned at Deloitte for two months. My first actuarial internship and a great start to the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended the SOA Hartford Student Connect. Great drive to the &amp;lsquo;Insurance capital of the world&amp;rsquo; and a good day spent meeting practicing actuaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought a new bike - my first ever road bike! [icon name=&amp;ldquo;bicycle&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interned at Atikus Insurance. Wonderful bunch of folks and great learning insights. Dabbled with macros the first time on a major project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went Seal watching and met an &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/adventure-travel/meeting-paul-swinburne&#34; title=&#34;Meeting Paul | Swinburne&#34;&gt;incredible champion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike ride around Central Park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drove to Toronto during the spring break. Ithaca en-route, was a pleasant surprise.[icon name=&amp;ldquo;road&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun road trip to Florida with the Bhaskars and a good time with the Nandurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/adventure-travel/adirondacks-it-is&#34; title=&#34;Adirondacks it is!&#34;&gt;Back to running&lt;/a&gt; after a long break. Ankle feels good but not yet ready for a Half.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decided not to run my first registered half-marathon in the US. Though extremely disappointed, I&amp;rsquo;ll learn later the sacrifice was worth it.  Meena runs a 10k and a few in the familia run halfs. If reactions post-run are any indicative, looks like I missed a lot of good-pain. Nevertheless, had a fun time just being there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Baltimore family moves. Daphne welcomes us earlier than anticipated!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meena moves to Chicago for the TFA institute. Atikus and serious exam prep keeps me busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passed the second actuarial exam. This one was long due! [icon name=&amp;ldquo;flag&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flew to Chicago for our second anniversary. The windy city doesn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint us! Drove the Jeep to NY. Ohio stretch was a pain with heavy road maintenance and blinding trucks. Loved the Philly stretch though! [icon name=&amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family drives over a weekend to Florida for nephew&amp;rsquo;s first birthday. Crazy yet happening weekend!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably one of my best running moments. Ragnar was &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/adventure-travel/appalachians-next&#34; title=&#34;Appalachians next!&#34;&gt;such an experience&lt;/a&gt;! My first ever relay run over 200 miles. These pristine routes call for a revisit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fall session creeps in with project deadlines almost every other day. Boy, this semester has been relentless!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Family is going places, this time to Jason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/book-review/deep-freediving&#34; title=&#34;Deep: Freediving and What the Ocean Tells Us about Ourselves&#34;&gt;Deep: Freediving and What the Ocean Tells Us about Ourselves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by James Nestor. The urge to scuba dive&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The runners group [read Ragnar team] decides to go all in for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/running/philadelphia-half&#34; title=&#34;Philadelphia Half&#34;&gt;Philly Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. Cave-in to the &amp;lsquo;runner&amp;rsquo;s pressure&amp;rsquo; and sign-up. Had a pretty decent run but decided not to run any more city runs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swimming sessions at the Y. With the wife as the coach, life can be a bit under-water!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Philly run ends with news on the line on a new entrant in the family. Nieces galore! This one seems to be born with a bunch of butterflies. Exciting times ahead!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The graduation heat is On!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait, the family is not yet done moving. This time to Ambiance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burning the midnight oil (The heater?) for the finals. You can&amp;rsquo;t really avoid those last-minute surprises. Can you? All said and done, I now hold a Master of Science! - One long-held desire, Checked.[icon name=&amp;ldquo;university&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last minute Christmas packing frenzy. Love this time of the year. Gifting is fun! [icon name=&amp;ldquo;gift&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signed off Christmas in Boston with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/activities/233479444&#34;&gt;5mi run along the Charles river&lt;/a&gt; and rang in the new year at Ambiance.[icon name=&amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;]&lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2010/12/30/looking-back-at-2010.../</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot thats been happening; but for some reason I just didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time out to visit this space. With the school closed down for the Christmas break and keeping up with the self imposed rule of updating my blog every year-end, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick snapshot  of &amp;lsquo;my&amp;rsquo; 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has been quite interesting from various perspectives. Looking back, the major checkpoints[not necessarily listed in order] this year  would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ran the infamous &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/blog/2010/02/running-through-the-woods/&#34;&gt;Auroville half marathon&lt;/a&gt; and vowed never to stop running!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/blog/2010/03/crossing-the-rickety-bridge/&#34;&gt;Resigned from Infosys&lt;/a&gt; to join TeachforIndia. [leaving an awesome team behind and making one profound shift in my career.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Met Paruammai, attended a close friends wedding and more importantly explored Kerala like never before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joined TFI and reveled in the five week long induction programme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the temptation to do the Katraj-Sinhagad night trek [Twice on successive weekends!] amidst the rigour of he institute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missed spending quality time with family!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reported to Epiphany School where I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching IInd grade kids for the past six months and probably continue to do so for the next 1.5yrs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid obeisance to the rain god by trekking the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=179352&amp;amp;id=796079081&amp;amp;ref=pb&#34;&gt;Kenjalgad fort&lt;/a&gt; [First monsoon trek by DH.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiked up to the Ahupe village to take some time out and celebrate yet another important milestone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visited the Khadakwasla dam.[Failed executing  the rock band idea though!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revisited[Hiked] Koraigad, Rajmachi and Ratangad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rode to Khadakwasla dam [Got back to the byke after a long break of 5 months!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registered for the MBL course by Distance education mode from NLSIU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visited the Korlai fort [Didn&amp;rsquo;t byke this time!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registered for the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon[My first Full Marathon!] and raised about 9500Rs. for TFI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ran the Pune Half marathon.[ Well, actually ran a 25!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turned 25 Years! Woohoo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ran the Goa River Marathon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Witnessed Shreks&amp;rsquo; [a co-fellow] wedding in Vizag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was gifted a Hookah, a mobile speaker , some invaluable coupons and a heart rate monitor!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realised that I could afford to save more than I thought I could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squared in and took some real important decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vowed to stick on to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; TOTALLY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that kind of summarizes the year that&amp;rsquo;s been till date. Tomorrow hopefully I would run a sweet 30k to siphon off 2010  and usher in 2011 and for some reason, I have this gut feeling that the next year would be even more eventful than this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishing you [And myself!] an awesome and happening year ahead&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reached home quite late after an active day at work. Scrapped the &amp;lsquo;New year party&amp;rsquo; plan and decided to crash after a quick dinner. A perfunctory check of my e-mail throws about twenty &amp;lsquo;greeting&amp;rsquo; mails. I invariably tend to shift+delete such e-mails as I prefer talking over the phone to e-mails/SMS/IM. But one particular mail from my sister just swept me off my feet..- &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;may this new year bring you closer and closer to everything you want to do&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; These simple words are something that have stood by me all through. Miles away, she&amp;rsquo;s someone who&amp;rsquo;s been such a wonderful source of motivation for each and everything I do - day in and day out and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any better way of thanking her than warding off my sleep to take snapshot of the amazing year 0f 2009!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I graduated, I decided I would do something starkly different or interesting every two to three years and this year very much stands as a testimony to that conviction.Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt to set my priorities straight and involve in activities that I think really stand for what truly represents me. I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt to trust my gut instinct more than anything else and live by my passions irrespective of what others think of me. On a personal front this year has been one of pursuing my passions like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Byking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve cumulatively ridden 1500kms the whole last year. That really isn&amp;rsquo;t much compared to what other serious bikers do but I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy with the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made. Transitioning from a trekker to a biker has been one hell of an experience and has got me to see a whole lot of wonderful places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Enduro3 national level adventure race was one humbling learning experience where I really got to see what I was made of and what I could achieve. It sort of  wedged out a window to judge my capabilities vis-a-vis expectations set by people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t snow here anymore!&amp;rsquo; This is what a villager up there in the lofty Himachal town of Jibhi had to say when we asked her about the weather there. Those innumerable climate change articles never really had any impact on me till I went up there on those mountain peaks. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/blog/2009/06/the-moron-the-bike-and-the-himalayas-jalori-pass-biking-expedition/&#34;&gt;Jalori Pass Mountain Biking&lt;/a&gt; expedition slammed me right on the face and got me thinking on what damage we &amp;rsquo;enlightened&amp;rsquo; people are causing. We snub our noses when we see someone damaging our property. Think of those people up there in the himalayas who&amp;rsquo;re bearing the brunt because of our insensible activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/blog/2009/09/the-korlai-ride/&#34;&gt;Korlai Ride&lt;/a&gt; was yet another stupendous ride that I would cherish for years to come. 205kms spanning three days in the mystical sahyadri ranges. It was just the man, the machine and nature!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Freedom Ride on the other hand was clearly something that cut across the point - It&amp;rsquo;s just not about the bike! 180+ riders riding together on Roadsters, Targets, Meridas and what not for 63kms on the roads of Hyderabad for the kids of Akshaya Akruthi. Boy, that was one hell of  a ride!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started running seriously sometime early in August and have clocked about 120kms till now. When I ran my first half marathon this November, the only goal I had in mind was to complete it without any glitches. I ended being ranked 100 out of the 220+ runners. For me personally, it&amp;rsquo;s not the distance or time that really matters. It&amp;rsquo;s more about the thought process that goes on in my mind during the run that I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2009 hasn&amp;rsquo;t really been a year of travel for various reasons. But then in those seasoned escapades, there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bidar ride - 20 riders, 10 bikes all set to explore the ramparts of the Bidar fort!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kalsubai Conquest - As I scaled up Maharashtra&amp;rsquo;s highest peak, a friend acquainted from a bus ride plopped off the Chembra peak. Life&amp;rsquo;s so unpredictable!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/blog/2009/05/kawal-wildlife-sanctuary-the-moron-vs-wild/&#34;&gt;Kawal Wildlife Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; - Stuck miserably for five grueling hours with four people I&amp;rsquo;d never met before in a wild life sanctuary with temperature  soaring to 40 deg.  Real testing times&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Junglethlon - Three days of Jungle survival course with a bunch of real interesting people. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t ask for a much better way to close the 2009 chapter!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day simply changed my outlook towards things and eventually my career. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably save this for another post but in the nutshell, a solid seed was borne early this June and I&amp;rsquo;m more than excited about things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about 01:15am here and the &amp;rsquo;new year&amp;rsquo; has already sprung in. Messages and e-mails are still swarming the networks and servers. Here&amp;rsquo;s wishing you folks a cheerful and happening new year! Fingers crossed on what 201o has in store&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
