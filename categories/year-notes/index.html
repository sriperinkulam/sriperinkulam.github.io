Brought out some ESC colleagues to Nevado de Toluca S celebrates her 6th with a unicorn Pinata. DEC M finally hears about her CA-AEFM position V&amp;D visit us for a week. The Merida cores trip goes great! Visit Guadalajara for Carlos’ wedding Houston visit was riddled with travel issues. Fun nevertheless! Fun trip to Las Estacas And that’s a wrap! 🔗 ...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-12-31 21:30:00 -0500 -0500'>December 31, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;736 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;SSP</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 2024 Year end note" href=https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/31/2024-year-end-note/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>2023 Year end note</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>JAN M&amp;S did a whirlwind trip to Abu dhabi, Dubai, Chennai.

Despite Covid, I did a bunch of travel which is always nice! Last August, Appa kinda lost his patience and wanted to make a trip to India. We figured September was the most optimal time and I flew over to MD to accompany him back. With just a day off work, I was able to finagle a whirlwind weekend trip to the US and back. M and S head over to the states in October to be a bit of a help in MD while I looked after two grand old men here in India. It’s been a while that I’ve done this and but for a few rough days, I loved spending time helping them accomplish what they wanted to over the course of three months. Appa was able to get most of his ‘admin’ stuff done and more importantly got to spend time with his younger brother.

The girls loved it and I couldn’t have asked for a better start. Exhilarating, to say the least. And oh, salt water does BURN your eyes! Shasta enjoyed her time on the beach with her grand-parents. Dainty princess that she is, she apparently had her shoes on - for the whole two hours. Nevertheless she did enjoy the early breezy morning, watching us fall umpteen number of times. When asked later, she did mention she thought we were exercising. We’ll go with that!

Convincing their parents last minute, Divyaa and Raaghuv drove up to Maryland with us. The kids had a ball of a time in the last row of the Sienna. We stopped over at Durham for the night and met Uncle Lou the next day for breakfast. Of course also visited Fuqua school of Business. Rajesh graduated from here and we so wished he was alive to show us around this campus. A gentle reminder to check-in with everyone near and dear every once in a while…

I somehow seem to have missed doing this for the past three years. Looking back, this year has been extremely fulfilling - both professionally and personally. Here’s a quick rewind:
January:
Interned at Deloitte for two months. My first actuarial internship and a great start to the year. February:
Attended the SOA Hartford Student Connect. Great drive to the ‘Insurance capital of the world’ and a good day spent meeting practicing actuaries. Bought a new bike - my first ever road bike!

With the school closed down for the Christmas break and keeping up with the self imposed rule of updating my blog every year-end, here’s a quick snapshot of ‘my’ 2010.
This year has been quite interesting from various perspectives. Looking back, the major checkpoints[not necessarily listed in order] this year would be:

Scrapped the ‘New year party’ plan and decided to crash after a quick dinner. A perfunctory check of my e-mail throws about twenty ‘greeting’ mails. I invariably tend to shift+delete such e-mails as I prefer talking over the phone to e-mails/SMS/IM. But one particular mail from my sister just swept me off my feet..- ‘may this new year bring you closer and closer to everything you want to do…’ These simple words are something that have stood by me all through. Miles away, she’s someone who’s been such a wonderful source of motivation for each and everything I do - day in and day out and I couldn’t see any better way of thanking her than warding off my sleep to take snapshot of the amazing year 0f 2009!

Happened to come across this when sifting through my e-mails and thought I’d save and back post this for records…
December 12th 2006:
It’s been almost six months that i’ve been placed in Infosys. But still at times, I find it hard to digest the fact that I hit the bull’s eye, right in the first shot! Having ideally no much expertise in coding languages, leave alone my own technical field, It’s been an admixture of both shock and surprises for me all the way through. If there had to be a core reason for me being placed, I would primarily attribute it to my Dad’s choice of enrolling me in the university that I am presently in. The reasons of enrolling me were way much different then. But does’nt everything happens for a reason?
