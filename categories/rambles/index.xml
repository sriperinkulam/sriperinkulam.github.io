      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;Sixth.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;S celebrated her 6th today.  Unicorn themed - of course - and had her first and probably last ever Piñata. But for a mega meltdown initially she did great all through the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we signed up for a Diwali party organized by the Indian Association in Mexico. Primarily on a whim and maybe for the food? The event was last evening and boy, it was a terrible disappointment! It started late as expected. And obnoxiously loud for no reason. Not quite sure if it was the acoustics at the venue or just the MC shouting into the mic.  Maybe both? I love some good rock and metal. I love some good loud music. But I guess not all loud is the same. Also, this day and age, who even does a looping slideshow of pictures of people organizing the event? Dinner was supposed to be served by 1900. Servers said they had orders to serve only at 2030. Maybe the organizers wanted the food to be served only after the main event? When we rechecked at 2030, they said it was pushed to 2130. Had enough of it and walked out.  People were still on the dance floor and there was a good turn out. I guess this kinda boisterous social mayhem is just not my jam?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We head out to a Japanese (?) restaurant in Polanco since Nimi&amp;rsquo;s, Mei Mei and Manaw were all closed for service. Sushi was &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;. S did great all through the evening though despite the loud music and the crowd. That &amp;lsquo;Sticker by number&amp;rsquo; book that she received as a gift from Maddy kept her fully occupied!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monday morning here and S is off for school. She was mildly upset that I get to stay at home while she needs to go to school. Fair world logic, I guess. We drop her and get to spend a couple hours together watching &lt;em&gt;Spenser Confidential&lt;/em&gt;. Enjoyed it all the more because we recognized quite a few locations where the movie was shot. M&amp;rsquo;s got some brunch out with the ladies in a bit and then a couple more hours before I need to pick up S. Maybe I should tweak that 3D printer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Dumbing down</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2023/12/24/dumbing-down/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few things I&amp;rsquo;d really like to dumb down or sort out over the next few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site&lt;/strong&gt;: This site runs on WordPress, has facets of the indieweb, has ActivityPub and a crude implementation of self engineered micropost interface. All cool but needs quite a trim to make the best use of all these features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware/Infra&lt;/strong&gt;: VPS, VPN, Odroid for reverse proxy, NCP, NUC, Moose, External hard disks&amp;hellip;Love the current implementation for the various utilities they serve. However, I see myself spending lesser and lesser time in front of the PC. Which is good? But which also means I need to find a better way to manage these in the little time I want to spend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPX&lt;/strong&gt;: Go on a hike or ride? Automatically log this on my site. Gotta have that super neat Stamen map. I did get really close to setting this up &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/09/garmin-plugin-2/&#34;&gt;sometime back&lt;/a&gt; but got left on the wayside. Also time to update my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin-stats/&#34;&gt;Outdoors plugin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firefly3&lt;/strong&gt;: Love this tool for finance tracking. Need to build that rule engine to automate some of those imports and reports.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snikket/Matrix/Slidge&lt;/strong&gt;: Need to get this sorted out to be part of those groups that still rely on WhatsApp. I setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/20/bridged/&#34;&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; sometime back but deleted it because I was rarely using it. More of a nice-to-have so may not quite get to this anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memories&lt;/strong&gt;: Selective photo sharing with family or friends. Send a link instead of sharing photos individually. Love the nextcloud setup so far. Would be neat if I can take this up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;: Kinda like my current Navidrome setup. Would like a bit more flexibility in terms of song or folder access though. Smarter playlists? Also multidevice sync? Music system?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes Sync&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently relying on Signal notes to self and Trilium send for bookmarks. Need to automate this for self sorting with tags in Trilium notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart sceen&lt;/strong&gt;: On demand and power efficient display for Calendars, Adana, Gallery, dashboard display, news updates etc. Thinking MagicMirror but a bit more optimized. Repurpose that RPi or Odroid once it&amp;rsquo;s all integrated into the NUC?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With quite a few things constantly evolving over the last several months, I haven&amp;rsquo;t actively paid much attention to this space. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/micro/&#34;&gt;micro posts&lt;/a&gt; now and then, but nowhere close to chronicling things as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to. This is a quick run down of a few things occupying my mind space:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about four months since we moved to Mexico City. We absolutely love it here. People are terrific, weather is just right, and this city&amp;rsquo;s got a dash of almost every city we&amp;rsquo;ve lived in so far! M&amp;amp;S have been able to explore the regular tourist spots thanks to the CLO trips. I&amp;rsquo;ve joined them for a few, but what I really enjoy is just experiencing the city for what it&amp;rsquo;s got to offer - And there&amp;rsquo;s no dearth to that. Absolutely blown away by the city planning and the presence of so many parks. The city is spectacularly clean for the number of people living here. Every Sunday one of the main avenues is closed out to vehicular traffic and opened out to runners, cyclists and essentially anybody who wants to enjoy the roads. Amazed at the resources that the local government is able to draw from to sustain this every single weekend! We haven&amp;rsquo;t been that lucky to find decent vegetarian food here. Most local restaurants offer some form of meat in almost all dishes and the vegetarian items are rarely tasty. Dining out definitely leaves a lot to be desired - unless of course you try out other cuisines. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s good food out there - yet to find it though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exactly a year since I took on the current position. Best career move I&amp;rsquo;ve made so far, and I absolutely love every part of my job. There&amp;rsquo;s not one day that&amp;rsquo;s akin to another and I&amp;rsquo;m constantly learning every day. Most days just whizz by with constant troubleshooting on systems and processes. I&amp;rsquo;m barely at my desk for an hour a day. Tracing power and logic is so refreshing - The adrenaline rush that comes when you&amp;rsquo;ve found that nuanced fault in the system is addictive. The closest I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to this in the past was while writing code for enhancing functionality in one of my side projects. Ironic that it took me fifteen years to realize what I&amp;rsquo;m really good at - fixing things! And now I get paid to play with toys and travel the world. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to travel to Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo and Hermosillo so far. These cities are so different from CDMX and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I get a chance to experience these regions of the country too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been biking to work most days and doing the Reforma ride on the weekends. So good to be back on the saddle so regularly. Met a couple folks from a trail running group here last weekend and would love to join them whenever time permits. Over the next few months I would also like to visit the National parks around the city. Not having a car is kinda limiting but definitely not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a family, we&amp;rsquo;ve really gotten into playing Zelda - Breath of the Wild. We each have our own profiles and are at different stages of the game. This is fascinating, engaging and such a good way to spend time together while indoors. S enjoys the challenges and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see how good she&amp;rsquo;s gotten at the game. Definitely getting the Tears of the Kingdom really soon!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been actively tinkering with my home-lab. Mostly doing the bare essentials to keep it updated and running. I&amp;rsquo;ve started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firefly-iii.org/&#34;&gt;FireFly III&lt;/a&gt; more actively to keep track of our expenses and for general budgeting. Since internet and power are decently reliable, I should probably move part of my home-lab over from MD to here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Building the end plan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leave a comment if any of this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. I&amp;rsquo;ll be more than happy to help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to setup a comprehensive and secure ‘handover’ document for my family - In case I cease to exist. My key priorities were it should :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;be easy to update and maintain when I am alive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;be easy to reference and access when I am dead&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;have multiple fall-back points&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the most straightforward way to do this would be to have all the information on a secure spreadsheet or document. But that&amp;rsquo;s not fun! So I decided to use Trilium Notes for it. When it&amp;rsquo;s time, my wife has three options to access the support checklist a) Online via a secure portal/app b) Using a secure flash-drive c) Old school printed sheets&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Screenshot-from-2021-08-06-15-05-32-1200x600.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is something super easy to replicate. Leaving this out here should someone find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get up and running:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grab the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.electronjs.org/apps/trilium-notes&#34;&gt;Trilium desktop app from here&lt;/a&gt; and install it on your machine. If it&amp;rsquo;s the first time you are using it, it should prompt you to create a local account. You can sync this with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/04/06/installing-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;server app&lt;/a&gt; later if you need one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On first install, Trilium also installs a demo document. This is super helpful to understand how Trilium works. But for now, collapse the &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Trilium Demo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; folder in the left sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Download my  &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sriperinkulam/closeout/raw/main/Closeout%20Template.zip&#34;&gt;Closeout html&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; template zip file. Right click on the &amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo; folder on the left sidebar and click &amp;lsquo;Import into&amp;rsquo;. Select the zip file you just downloaded and click on &amp;lsquo;Import&amp;rsquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s it! Update the template to your needs and export for backups.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining and backups:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To encrypt the folder, just right click on  and select &amp;lsquo;protect subtree&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trilium provides you three modes of export - Zipped HTML, Zipped markdown and OPML. I prefer the HTML export since it can be used in isolation. Do note however that all notes lose their encryption when they&amp;rsquo;re exported out!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generic notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Trilium notes since it fits into my workflow. You should be able to import the template into any note-taking app.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The template is obviously bare minimum and generic. Tweak/add based on your personal situation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally kept my guidance instructions and passwords isolated since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be printing them on paper. You could have them all in one place here in Trilium and secure the folder.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If saving the files/backups on a flash drive, I&amp;rsquo;d strongly recommend you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/11/01/encrypting-drives/&#34;&gt;VeraCrypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a reasonably healthy person with no alarming issues. But hey, you never know! I think it&amp;rsquo;s critical that your family has good guidance on how best to pick up where you left off. Think of this as the last parting gift. It took me about four years of procrastination and few spurts of action to get here. And I am so glad I did. If not anything, it&amp;rsquo;s helping me document these critical pieces in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your life closeout plan?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since March 2020, I&amp;rsquo;ve had this internal debate of getting the Covid Vaccine mostly underlined by the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3d3bb2ac73.65468826&#34;&gt;science behind mRNA&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating and so is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3c8962f2a2.96282489&#34;&gt;engineering of the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every strand of mRNA is made up of four molecular building blocks called nucleosides. But in its altered, synthetic form, one of those building blocks, like a misaligned wheel on a car, was throwing everything off by signaling the immune system. So Karikó and Weissman simply subbed it out for a slightly tweaked version, creating a hybrid mRNA that could sneak its way into cells without alerting the body’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Statnews&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We unfortunately &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html%5D&#34;&gt;have not had a spectacular history&lt;/a&gt; with vaccines. With humans involved and the ensuing politics, money and power-plays; vaccines are built for the average human being. Then with anything manufactured and delivered at scale, we&amp;rsquo;re prone to Logistics and Supply chain Management issues.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Covid19 vaccines are not a once and done deal. The effects &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/607a14edb61f01.57427531&#34;&gt;last apparently at most a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did cave in and got the first ‘jab&amp;rsquo; of the Moderna vaccine today at the Consulate. As with all vaccines and medical interventions, this was not quite an easy decision. The decision was probably 40% gut, 40% trusting the mechanics of the mRNA vaccine and 20% of &amp;lsquo;Why am I even considering it&amp;rsquo;. The drivers for the gut-feeling likely being:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Getting the vaccine would possibly break the link in transmitting the virus to an immune-compromised person. We live with our in-laws and that&amp;rsquo;s the least I can do for them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I consider myself to be a fairly young and healthy person and absolutely do not mind wearing masks and exercising social distancing. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve shamefully caught myself pulling down the mask during brief interactions with people. Despite best efforts, the masking system alone is not fool-proof.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to be outdoors to stay healthy and be sane. Travel and Freedom are my primary &amp;lsquo;movers&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From an extremely exaggerated perspective, I see C19 as the Smallpox / Polio of this century. Few folks in the family are still reeling with the brutal after-effects of these diseases. I think I can take the risk of the possible side-effects for the marginal leg-up the vaccine might give my immune system in case I contract the virus.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Folks in the family are leaning towards getting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/607a1f2977e8c3.93743514&#34;&gt;Covaxin&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. India is having it&amp;rsquo;s worst wave so far and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping we swing back downwards as sharply as we rose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Stimulus</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2021/03/11/stimulus/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting point on M1 and M2 [Measures of money]. With the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.allsides.com/story/biden-signs-19-trillion-covid-19-relief-bill-law&#34;&gt;signing of the 1.9T$ bill today&lt;/a&gt; in the US, we&amp;rsquo;ve essentially created 6T$ over the last 10 months. Just like that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Covid19 has brought  unprecedented suffering to many. Deaths, Unemployment, Medical complications, lifestyle changes, Social unrest and several other ramifications which we are yet to experience. If anything, it has taught us highlighted how abysmally poor we are in collectively addressing pressing issues. It has also shown us that when disaster strikes, we only take care of our own and we are selectively biased even at that. Nature gave us yet another opportunity to show how we could better ourselves and elevate us to the next stage of evolution and we miserably failed. With our myopic non-collaborative actions, pushing politics and power over general good, we&amp;rsquo;ve defined a new low. Mileage on isolated or individual efforts unfortunately does not carry the ripple effect that can scale. Nothing surprising there - Humans are selfish creatures. We of course needed something to balance all the &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt; and cognitive advances we supposedly have over other living things. Humanity rests is constant chaos and Covid19 was continues to fuel that chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quite a digression, eh?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Health Insurance woes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/03/09/health-insurance-woes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pleasantly surprised to read this piece from ProPublica/NPR. Michael Frank was my professor for a Health Insurance course I took while at Columbia and he was a terrific one at it. Though I moved on to Property and Casualty Insurance as an Actuarial Analyst, I continue to be intrigued by Health. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be - Such an entangled mess that the U.S. Insurance space is!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I am a strong proponent of Insurance. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent years mining through claims data and have seen the tremendous benefits, a well structured Insurance plan provides - for both parties involved. Where we&amp;rsquo;re actually faltering is the policies and regulations that govern the Insurance markets. Profits drive decisions and the U.S. healthcare system is on an abysmal downward spiral latching on to just the monetary front. Why in this day and age is it unclear how much I might owe when I visit my Physician or undergo a procedure? I&amp;rsquo;d much rather pay higher taxes than live in eternal uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not going to happen anytime soon and till we even see that silver lining, all one can do is rely on things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.healthcarebluebook.com&#34;&gt;Healthcare Bluebook&lt;/a&gt; and make triple-sure every single doctor who&amp;rsquo;s going to be getting any close to you is in-network on your health plan!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Lifting the veil</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/signal-2021-01-17-045708_002-scaled.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;Just about a decade ago, we leased a property on a pristine and desolate beach. The house didn&amp;rsquo;t have robust walls - It just had a few curtains to protect us from the elements. The rooms internally had walls full of transparent glass. It was a beautiful property with lots of cross-ventilation and something that was just right for our family. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time, more people moved in around us and it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel all that secluded. Visitors to the beach, neighbors and more so the property owner started getting more interested in our mundane lives. At times we felt, they were interested more in us than the pristine beach. The property owner started hiking the rent overtime and started charging us for random things. At one point, he even started deciding when we could actually use the beach. As much as we&amp;rsquo;d wanted to stay at that place and enjoy the neighbors company, we decided it was time to take things in control. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We got out of the lease and built our own property in the adjacent lot. This time though we had beautiful bamboo walls and lots of open windows with blinds. We had complete control on whom we could connect with and more importantly when we really wanted to. We still had nothing to hide. However we did have everything in the world to protect. Times have changed and it&amp;rsquo;s no outsiders business to benefit from your matter of regular affairs. Changing our lifestyle a bit was a small price to pay and though inconvenient at times, we&amp;rsquo;ve mastered the ropes and are now in a much better place. And quite honestly, we weren&amp;rsquo;t alone. Lots of people have made that shift and we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a ton from each other&amp;rsquo;s experience. It&amp;rsquo;s in fact a lot more easier now than before. You just need to ask if your stuck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve read this far, you&amp;rsquo;d obviously realize for the most part, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to my digital life. No actually yours too. It&amp;rsquo;s high time we take more control and move out of these information sucking centralized systems. In this day and age there&amp;rsquo;s no reason why you should be tethered to the pseudo social construct of facebook, twitter, instagram and what-not. I urge you to revert to the old-school world of blogging. Use an &lt;a href=&#34;https://miniflux.app/&#34;&gt;RSS reader&lt;/a&gt; - let the information come to you on your terms and not on algorithms that mine your data for someone else. Privacy in the current form is a hoax and it is time we lift the veil and make those small changes for the network-effect to take place. And trust me, it is so absolutely worth it once you clear the veil. Over the last decade there have been fabulous movements [&lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fediverse.party/&#34;&gt;fediverse&lt;/a&gt;] that have risen to give you more control over your data. And then there are a ton of terrific options out there:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;E-mail: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastmail.com/&#34;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://protonmail.com/&#34;&gt;Protonmail&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://postale.io/&#34;&gt;Postale.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Messaging: &lt;a href=&#34;https://delta.chat/en/&#34;&gt;Delta-chat&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/&#34;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://blabber.im/en/&#34;&gt;Blabber.im&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://wire.com/en/&#34;&gt;Wire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Files: &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextcloud.com/&#34;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seafile.com/en/home/&#34;&gt;Seafile&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://syncthing.net/&#34;&gt;Syncthing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Video calls: &lt;a href=&#34;https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/&#34;&gt;Jitsi&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://jami.net/&#34;&gt;Jami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Youtube: &lt;a href=&#34;http://invidious.snopyta.org/&#34;&gt;Invidious&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://joinpeertube.org/&#34;&gt;Peertube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Evernote: &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/07/migrating-over-to-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;Trilium Notes&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://joplinapp.org/&#34;&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://standardnotes.org/&#34;&gt;Standard notes&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/features.html&#34;&gt;Org-mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Facebook: &lt;a href=&#34;https://micro.blog/&#34;&gt;Microblog&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://withknown.com/&#34;&gt;Known&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://diasporafoundation.org/&#34;&gt;Diaspora&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://mewe.com/&#34;&gt;MeWe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twitter: &lt;a href=&#34;https://joinmastodon.org/&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.minds.com/&#34;&gt;Minds&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://gnu.io/social/&#34;&gt;GNU Social&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://friendi.ca/&#34;&gt;Friendica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reddit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://getaether.net/&#34;&gt;Aether&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://lemmy.ml/&#34;&gt;Lemmy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Blogs: &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://write.as/&#34;&gt;Write.as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Instagram: &lt;a href=&#34;https://pixelfed.org/&#34;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunlit.io/&#34;&gt;Sunlit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;GoodReads: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.librarything.com/&#34;&gt;Librarything&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thestorygraph.com/&#34;&gt;StoryGraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Phones: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sustaphones.com/&#34;&gt;Sustaphones&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/&#34;&gt;Pinephone&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/&#34;&gt;Librem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the above apps work right out of the box. There&amp;rsquo;s so little that you really need to change or setup. If you&amp;rsquo;re still concerned about moving your extended communities over to the platform - Take that plunge and make the move. People who do want to stay in touch with you will follow!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if anything seems ever barely daunting - Just ask! I&amp;rsquo;ll be super glad to set something up for you or point you in the right direction. &lt;strong&gt;What is it that is holding you back from making the switch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Came across this phenomenal documentary from Patagonia about the Tarkine in North western Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminded me of the incessant wood logging that I witnessed almost on every backpacking trip across the western ghats in India. Irrationality of humans blows my mind beyond all proportions.

      <title>Marrow Donor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in India, about eight years ago a colleague of mine sent out out an e-mail blast to the company bulletin board checking to see if anyone was a marrow donor. His son needed a transplant and the odd&amp;rsquo;s weren&amp;rsquo;t in his favor. I had no clue what that entailed and read up a bit on it.  Later that evening as I tried registering on to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bethematch.org/&#34;&gt;Be the match&lt;/a&gt; portal, I realized they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the support framework to sign-on users outside the U.S. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take a minute for me to close the tab and get back to what I was doing. A couple weeks later I learnt the kid died and somewhere deep in my heart I regretted not trying harder to sign-up or figure a way around. But again with all things good and bad, that moment passed and I moved on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few months back a good old friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159199967110109&amp;amp;set=a.10152114894075109.905086.546630108&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater&#34;&gt;shared a post&lt;/a&gt; seeking marrow donors. I had no excuses this time around. I immediately signed up online and received the swab kit in a few days. Sent that out just before we flew to India for a short trip and late last month I received my donor card. It&amp;rsquo;s highly unlikely I&amp;rsquo;ll be called in for a match. But I&amp;rsquo;m psyched! If not anything, I&amp;rsquo;ve incremented the list of very short Indian origin donors by one. Given the lack of pro-activeness in such issues I see within the Indian society (even within my own family), there&amp;rsquo;s a long way to go. This has to change! We need more people in the pool for this to work and just cannot wait until a close family member falls sick to realize the monstrosity of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my goals over the next few months is to coax more of my family members to sign-up. It all starts in your home!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/cropped-cropped-SP01-550afdebv1_site_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com&#34;&gt;Srikanth Perinkulam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/favorite?tweet_id=938889294730727424&#34;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?tweet_id=938889294730727424&#34;&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=938889294730727424&#34;&gt;repost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several years back when I got my scuba diving certification,  I literally had no words to describe my experience. A few years later when I chanced upon James Nestor&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/book-review/deep-freediving/&#34;&gt;Deep&lt;/a&gt; on free diving, I was shocked, mesmerized and stoked all at once. I literally gulped the book and to date it is one of those books that I could totally get absorbed in one go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I keep telling Miss Me how at times, I catch myself not breathing. While mostly it&amp;rsquo;s psychological, I also believe at some level it is sub-conscious. And then when you&amp;rsquo;re almost consumed by the mundane necessities with everyday chores, videos such as this bring your breath back - in one whole swoop.There&amp;rsquo;s so much depth in this video that keeps you wanting to re-watch it. I love the cold and freezing temperatures. I yearn for vast, untouched landscapes. And true silence gets me deeply captivated. This clip encompasses all that in so many levels all through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/182834827&#34;&gt;https://vimeo.com/182834827&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if that didn&amp;rsquo;t do enough justice here&amp;rsquo;s the behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[embed]https://vimeo.com/183326232[/embed]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday we had a plausible mishap on the road. On our way to New Haven, the Jeep started self-accelerating and the brakes didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work. Luckily there weren&amp;rsquo;t many cars on the road and we were on a slight positive gradient. With whatever little brake power left, I was able to reduce the speed to the sub 50s and tried using the rumble strips on the shoulder to further decelerate. I eventually got the vehicle to come to a rough halt with some gear shifts and a crude ignition stall. Just in time before a merge from the right!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple of calls to AAA and we were soon towed to a nearby Firestone. The garage was already busy with other cars and we were told we had to wait a couple of hours before they could even look at the issue. Soon after lunch, Meena and I were deliberating if we should tow the vehicle all the way back to Boston. With the garage closing at 5, we weren&amp;rsquo;t very optimistic that the folks here would be able to get to and resolve the issue over the next 3 hours. As we mentioned this to Bob, the chief mechanic; he said he was just about to have someone look at the car. We decide to give them a shot. They got the car into the shed and after about half an hour, Bob comes back saying they weren&amp;rsquo;t able to replicate the issue. However, he said they knew what could have possibly caused the mysterious acceleration. He mentioned it was highly likely the floor mat moved up during the drive, crumpled and entrapped the gas pedal leading to unintended acceleration. The brakes thus didn’t seem to work. I was hysterically pleased - both at the simple &amp;lsquo;fix&amp;rsquo; and at the hundreds of dollars we&amp;rsquo;d saved by not towing the vehicle back home. We soon hit the road, and got rid of the floor mat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the way back home, we hit quite some traffic. It nevertheless gave me some mind space to think. There were quite a few ways the incidents earlier during the day could have transpired. Had there been more traffic on our way to New Haven, we possibly would be dealing with a couple of totaled cars and the ramifications that came with it. Had we rejected Bob&amp;rsquo;s offer, we quite possibly would have towed the car all the way back to Boston. Even better, Bob could have easily said something else was wrong with the car and made a quick buck out of the whole issue. Later on Sunday night, I learnt the ignition stall could possibly be a bad idea since it lets the vehicle essentially lose control. Evidently it worked fine this time around, possibly since I triggered it at around 20mph. And to think of it, a lot more could have gone wrong. The proverbial - &amp;lsquo;Everything happens for a reason&amp;rsquo; is just not true. I believe the human brain does a wonderful job in assigning a reason to the cause and quite conveniently this is always subtly and retrospectively done. In its quest to find reason, it ends up triggering neural connections that emotionally and logically seem reasonable. So when and how do we draw the line while making choices and how do you substantiate the choices you&amp;rsquo;ve made? Or is the whole premise that as a logical and emotional machine you&amp;rsquo;re feeding good and bad data (choices) as a stimulus to train the body to better react to unforeseeable situations in the future?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
