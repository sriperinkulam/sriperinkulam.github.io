      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;Sixth.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;S celebrated her 6th today.  Unicorn themed - of course - and had her first and probably last ever Piñata. But for a mega meltdown initially she did great all through the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we signed up for a Diwali party organized by the Indian Association in Mexico. Primarily on a whim and maybe for the food? The event was last evening and boy, it was a terrible disappointment! It started late as expected. And obnoxiously loud for no reason. Not quite sure if it was the acoustics at the venue or just the MC shouting into the mic.  Maybe both? I love some good rock and metal. I love some good loud music. But I guess not all loud is the same. Also, this day and age, who even does a looping slideshow of pictures of people organizing the event? Dinner was supposed to be served by 1900. Servers said they had orders to serve only at 2030. Maybe the organizers wanted the food to be served only after the main event? When we rechecked at 2030, they said it was pushed to 2130. Had enough of it and walked out.  People were still on the dance floor and there was a good turn out. I guess this kinda boisterous social mayhem is just not my jam?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We head out to a Japanese (?) restaurant in Polanco since Nimi&amp;rsquo;s, Mei Mei and Manaw were all closed for service. Sushi was &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;. S did great all through the evening though despite the loud music and the crowd. That &amp;lsquo;Sticker by number&amp;rsquo; book that she received as a gift from Maddy kept her fully occupied!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monday morning here and S is off for school. She was mildly upset that I get to stay at home while she needs to go to school. Fair world logic, I guess. We drop her and get to spend a couple hours together watching &lt;em&gt;Spenser Confidential&lt;/em&gt;. Enjoyed it all the more because we recognized quite a few locations where the movie was shot. M&amp;rsquo;s got some brunch out with the ladies in a bit and then a couple more hours before I need to pick up S. Maybe I should tweak that 3D printer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Dumbing down</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2023/12/24/dumbing-down/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ssphugo@srkn.anonaddy.com (Srikanth Perinkulam)</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2023/12/24/dumbing-down/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few things I&amp;rsquo;d really like to dumb down or sort out over the next few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site&lt;/strong&gt;: This site runs on WordPress, has facets of the indieweb, has ActivityPub and a crude implementation of self engineered micropost interface. All cool but needs quite a trim to make the best use of all these features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware/Infra&lt;/strong&gt;: VPS, VPN, Odroid for reverse proxy, NCP, NUC, Moose, External hard disks&amp;hellip;Love the current implementation for the various utilities they serve. However, I see myself spending lesser and lesser time in front of the PC. Which is good? But which also means I need to find a better way to manage these in the little time I want to spend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPX&lt;/strong&gt;: Go on a hike or ride? Automatically log this on my site. Gotta have that super neat Stamen map. I did get really close to setting this up &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/09/garmin-plugin-2/&#34;&gt;sometime back&lt;/a&gt; but got left on the wayside. Also time to update my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin-stats/&#34;&gt;Outdoors plugin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firefly3&lt;/strong&gt;: Love this tool for finance tracking. Need to build that rule engine to automate some of those imports and reports.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snikket/Matrix/Slidge&lt;/strong&gt;: Need to get this sorted out to be part of those groups that still rely on WhatsApp. I setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/20/bridged/&#34;&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; sometime back but deleted it because I was rarely using it. More of a nice-to-have so may not quite get to this anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memories&lt;/strong&gt;: Selective photo sharing with family or friends. Send a link instead of sharing photos individually. Love the nextcloud setup so far. Would be neat if I can take this up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;: Kinda like my current Navidrome setup. Would like a bit more flexibility in terms of song or folder access though. Smarter playlists? Also multidevice sync? Music system?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes Sync&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently relying on Signal notes to self and Trilium send for bookmarks. Need to automate this for self sorting with tags in Trilium notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart sceen&lt;/strong&gt;: On demand and power efficient display for Calendars, Adana, Gallery, dashboard display, news updates etc. Thinking MagicMirror but a bit more optimized. Repurpose that RPi or Odroid once it&amp;rsquo;s all integrated into the NUC?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With quite a few things constantly evolving over the last several months, I haven&amp;rsquo;t actively paid much attention to this space. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/micro/&#34;&gt;micro posts&lt;/a&gt; now and then, but nowhere close to chronicling things as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to. This is a quick run down of a few things occupying my mind space:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about four months since we moved to Mexico City. We absolutely love it here. People are terrific, weather is just right, and this city&amp;rsquo;s got a dash of almost every city we&amp;rsquo;ve lived in so far! M&amp;amp;S have been able to explore the regular tourist spots thanks to the CLO trips. I&amp;rsquo;ve joined them for a few, but what I really enjoy is just experiencing the city for what it&amp;rsquo;s got to offer - And there&amp;rsquo;s no dearth to that. Absolutely blown away by the city planning and the presence of so many parks. The city is spectacularly clean for the number of people living here. Every Sunday one of the main avenues is closed out to vehicular traffic and opened out to runners, cyclists and essentially anybody who wants to enjoy the roads. Amazed at the resources that the local government is able to draw from to sustain this every single weekend! We haven&amp;rsquo;t been that lucky to find decent vegetarian food here. Most local restaurants offer some form of meat in almost all dishes and the vegetarian items are rarely tasty. Dining out definitely leaves a lot to be desired - unless of course you try out other cuisines. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s good food out there - yet to find it though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exactly a year since I took on the current position. Best career move I&amp;rsquo;ve made so far, and I absolutely love every part of my job. There&amp;rsquo;s not one day that&amp;rsquo;s akin to another and I&amp;rsquo;m constantly learning every day. Most days just whizz by with constant troubleshooting on systems and processes. I&amp;rsquo;m barely at my desk for an hour a day. Tracing power and logic is so refreshing - The adrenaline rush that comes when you&amp;rsquo;ve found that nuanced fault in the system is addictive. The closest I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to this in the past was while writing code for enhancing functionality in one of my side projects. Ironic that it took me fifteen years to realize what I&amp;rsquo;m really good at - fixing things! And now I get paid to play with toys and travel the world. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to travel to Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo and Hermosillo so far. These cities are so different from CDMX and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I get a chance to experience these regions of the country too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been biking to work most days and doing the Reforma ride on the weekends. So good to be back on the saddle so regularly. Met a couple folks from a trail running group here last weekend and would love to join them whenever time permits. Over the next few months I would also like to visit the National parks around the city. Not having a car is kinda limiting but definitely not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a family, we&amp;rsquo;ve really gotten into playing Zelda - Breath of the Wild. We each have our own profiles and are at different stages of the game. This is fascinating, engaging and such a good way to spend time together while indoors. S enjoys the challenges and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see how good she&amp;rsquo;s gotten at the game. Definitely getting the Tears of the Kingdom really soon!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been actively tinkering with my home-lab. Mostly doing the bare essentials to keep it updated and running. I&amp;rsquo;ve started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firefly-iii.org/&#34;&gt;FireFly III&lt;/a&gt; more actively to keep track of our expenses and for general budgeting. Since internet and power are decently reliable, I should probably move part of my home-lab over from MD to here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Weeknote 23 - Breath and Infento</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few things that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://distanceathletics.com/trainer/david-bidler/&#34;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; offered us a complementary sign-in to his &lt;a href=&#34;https://breathetoperform.mykajabi.com/catchyourbreath&#34;&gt;Breathing Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Excited to get that rolling! He&amp;rsquo;s also released his first book - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thebreathetoperformprogram.com/&#34;&gt;Breathe to Perform&lt;/a&gt;. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get our hands on it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been strongly considering moving over from WordPress to a static site generator. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using WordPress for 15 or so years now and have had absolutely no issues. The minimalism factor of static site generators makes it quite appealing though and then there&amp;rsquo;s that constant nudge to try something new. Will have to weight that against the migration work involved and take a call.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a 2TB Seagate drive and connected it to my &amp;lsquo;Mothership&amp;rsquo; laptop. I split it into two partitions - one acts as the secondary backup of the files I save on my RPi+WD1TB drive and the other for files I do not necessarily need on NC. While at it, I also setup an rsync pull from my Hetzner Cloud server to backup my docker volumes. Keeping the backups manual for now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text-plain&#34; data-lang=&#34;text-plain&#34;&gt;sudo rsync -nchavzP --delete --stats user@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/path/to/docker/volumes/ &#xA;&amp;#34;/media/Drive/partition2/Hetzner Backup/&amp;#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite a few interesting developments since I sent in a blurb to the TFI alumni group. I&amp;rsquo;ve expanded my &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/services/&#34;&gt;services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; a bit more now and I see it as a way of contributing to the educational ecosystem back in India.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meena suggested I build a bike for Shasta. I was initially looking at building a no-nonsense mobile platform - just a plank on three wheels and a pedal. While looking at options though, I chanced upon Infento. Looked very promising and loved the modular aspect of it. So we went ahead and ordered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.infento.com/product/explorer-kit/&#34;&gt;Infento Explorer kit&lt;/a&gt;. Should be delivered sometime today!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The US is going through some real dark times now. We&amp;rsquo;ve not even come out of the pandemic (which we grossly mismanaged). It feels like we&amp;rsquo;re back to square one and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be like this! What is it that drives humans to these abysmal depths?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currently Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten back to reading books! With so many things on the to-do list, reading in the past did take a back-seat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The adventurer&amp;rsquo;s son - A memoir by Dial and Roman&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Wedge by Scott Carney&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Art of Invisibility by Kevin Mitnick&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;LikeWar – The Weaponization of Social Media by Emerson T. Brooking, P.W. Singer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Art of Thinking Clearly by Rolf Dobelli&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Click Here to Kill Everybody by Bruce Schneier&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Started listening to &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/book-review/the-wedge/&#34;&gt;Passenger List&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few things that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the kids at home, weather mostly good and the lock-down lifted we did venture out a bit and got a lot of hikes in this week. We obviously had all masks on and avoided crowded spaces. Also had this sudden realization that most of the hikes I was doing over the past few years in Baltimore were on the banks of the Patapsco river. Would be wonderful to plan a good long 15-20 miler one of these days. Should be a good recce for the half-marathon that I said I would organize for Meena, Nancy and Sharath next month!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wonderful talk with Atchuth last night on servers and hosting content! On my end, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/17/switched/&#34;&gt;installed a small switch&lt;/a&gt; for my devices. Also ordered a 2TB external drive since the laptop that I backup my files on is slowly reaching full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Took appa out for a drive yesterday. His first outing in over three months now. I think it&amp;rsquo;s reasonably safe for him to head outdoors now. I do really want to take him to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/17/number-nine-trolley-trail-hike/&#34;&gt;Number nine trolley hike&lt;/a&gt; we did today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely loving the share article feature on Wallabag (And also Selfoss). It helps me share articles with family and friends without the annoying ads while providing a link to the source. I totally understand that certain publishers need ads to produce quality journalism. What I am not comfortable with is, them using that to track me. In the links that I share below, most are linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;my wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s public share. If I refer to an individual&amp;rsquo;s blog post however, I&amp;rsquo;ll link directly to the source. The only downside to that is, people tend to move across CMS or blogging software and links get orphaned&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://e.foundation/&#34;&gt;The /e/ Foundation&lt;/a&gt;: My next phone is most likely going to be running this OS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/17/optimizing-images/&#34;&gt;Jpegoptim&lt;/a&gt;: Linux tools to compress images on a whim&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/octomom&#34;&gt;Octomom&lt;/a&gt;: The octopus species that broods its eggs for close to five years!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ec1a002090d83.01810323&#34;&gt;What does your gaze reveal about you?&lt;/a&gt;: A ridiculous whole lot! Will have to get back to this later to explore more of the links. The amount of information that can be gleaned and analyzed is pretty intriguing.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few things that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weather&amp;rsquo;s been pretty erratic this week. We also had a mild dusting yesterday out of the blue! Might consider heading out for a hike later today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I nudged Meena to write more. We&amp;rsquo;ve had some interesting discussions on Yoga and other things over the past week and I do think she has a ton to share! She&amp;rsquo;s also planning to train for a 50miler which I am super excited about! Oh and beyond all that marketing ploy, Happy Mothers&amp;rsquo; day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shasta&amp;rsquo;s talking a lot more now. Pretty sure her verbal diarrhea is soon going to start soon too!  The other day, while sitting with Appa she said something to the effect of &amp;lsquo;i-pae&amp;rsquo; pointing to the ipad. Grandfather and daughter are totally connecting on these gadgets!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Git: I agree on many levels with &lt;a href=&#34;https://kevq.uk/confession-i-have-no-idea-how-to-use-git/&#34;&gt;what Kev posted recently&lt;/a&gt; about Github. I enjoy working on and deploying software tools. What I do not enjoy is the whole git pull, push, fork thing!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sessions: I am running a session later this week for the Khat-pat folks on self hosting. Planning to keep it mostly hands-on and crisp. The idea is to get them started on taking better control of their presence on the interwebs! I&amp;rsquo;d also love to join the Indieweb folks one of these days. They have &lt;a href=&#34;https://events.indieweb.org/2020/05/online-indieweb-meetup-nyc-vkY32vBfCTEJ&#34;&gt;one coming up on the 20th&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tools: Earlier this week, I came across e-mail cloaking services - &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplelogin.io/&#34;&gt;Simplelogin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://anonaddy.com/&#34;&gt;Anondaddy&lt;/a&gt;. Love the idea and I might give them a shot the next time I subscribe or sign-up for a service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feed Readers: Over the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve used multiple feed readers - Netvibes, TheOldReader, FreshRSS and Fever. They were all good in specific aspects but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really find them to be that one tool which I could use to consume the inter-webs my way. Earlier this week I decided to self-host one and narrowed down to FreshRSS, miniflux and selfoss. After a few iterations of deploying and testing, I stuck with &lt;a href=&#34;https://selfoss.aditu.de/&#34;&gt;selfoss&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s super light-weight and has all the specific features I was looking for.  To deploy it on docker, I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/04/28/deploying-known-on-a-docker-stack/&#34;&gt;boiler-plate template that I created earlier&lt;/a&gt; when setting up my &lt;a href=&#34;https://known.srkn.org&#34;&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; instance.  The gist file for the docker-compose is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/sriperinkulam/bf31682e6d9805ac29d6e4ff02bacb28&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The install should take you at most 10 minutes assuming you have the base framework setup. What I do love about selfoss is the ability to push articles over to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;wallabag&lt;/a&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trilium: I&amp;rsquo;ve moved most of my notes over to Trilium and I am absolutely loving it! While it&amp;rsquo;s hierarchical, it is also setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Patterns-of-personal-knowledge-base&#34;&gt;not to be one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5eb322c0461ff3.59682906&#34;&gt;Time-restricted eating&lt;/a&gt;: Philip &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philipbrewer.net/2020/05/03/experiments-with-time-restricted-eating/&#34;&gt;referenced this article recently&lt;/a&gt; and I think it&amp;rsquo;s brilliant! Also went ahead and signed up for Rhonda&amp;rsquo;s podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5eb705c2235124.51234929&#34;&gt;Tracking using ultrasound frequencies&lt;/a&gt;: Whoa! This totally blew my mind! If google uses it to connect your devices with chrome cast, what&amp;rsquo;s really stopping them from using it to track what you are watching? And now how do you block that invasion?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5eb6f8cbd8a783.67620597&#34;&gt;Workplaces in the era&lt;/a&gt;: Firms will have additional pressure from (or will be incentivised by) their insurance companies to have monitoring in place. Over the span of few months, this will be the new normal. Looking back, haven&amp;rsquo;t we all got used to keying-in and out at our workplaces?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5eb700e76826f2.47966883&#34;&gt;We kill people based on metadata&lt;/a&gt;: Quite a lot is changed since 2014. What hasn&amp;rsquo;t though is how fragmented and withdrawn several government and private entities are even in times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5eb7034fba3519.79379071&#34;&gt;The mystic veil of End-to-End encryption&lt;/a&gt;: Interesting read on the data sharing between these apps.  The other day I was wondering how &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bark.us/&#34;&gt;Bark&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s able to access messages from these apps. Likely they have something on these lines drifting underneath? While I love the concept of the app and the benefits it provides, I did cringe and walk away because I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how they&amp;rsquo;d be handling the data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Weeknote 17 - Covid19, Webmentions and Migrations</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/04/24/weeknote-17-covid19-webmentions-and-migrations/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2020/04/24/weeknote-17-covid19-webmentions-and-migrations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week I got a better handle at deploying and maintaining docker images. With that squared out, I decided to decommission the Digital Ocean servers that I had setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/03/02/migrations-workflows/&#34;&gt;back in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and migrate the applications over to my Hetzner server. I no longer have to rely on ServerPilot. All my applications are now deployed as docker containers fronted by #Traefik as a reverse proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The jitsi server instance I &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/04/19/self-hosting-jitsi-video-conferencing/&#34;&gt;deployed last week&lt;/a&gt; has been serving pretty well so far! I tweaked it further to enable &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.radiumz.org/en/article/local-recording-jitsi-meet&#34;&gt;local recording&lt;/a&gt;. Meena has been using it to run her online Yoga sessions and she can now also use it to record the podcast that she soon plans to start! Session recording and live-streaming is something I still need to configure in my current setup. The logs indicate it&amp;rsquo;s failing on the Jibri handshake and that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ll need to figure out once I have a bit more time in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other actionable tasks on the tech front include figuring out a swift way to deploy PHP based applications on Docker. I still need to port over my Known and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pixel.srkn.org/sriperinkulam&#34;&gt;PixelFed&lt;/a&gt; applications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philipbrewer.net/&#34;&gt;Philip&lt;/a&gt; nudged me to look into my webmentions. The theme I previously had wasn&amp;rsquo;t displaying them as comments. I needed a bit of a &amp;lsquo;creativity boost&amp;rsquo; and decided to use a new theme. Really liked the McLuhan theme by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.andersnoren.se/teman/mcluhan-wordpress-theme/&#34;&gt;Anders Noren&lt;/a&gt; and decided to give it a spin. Noticed &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/mcluhan-comments-fetched-are-from-a-different-post/#new-topic-0&#34;&gt;a minor issue with the comments section&lt;/a&gt; and was easily able to fix it. I do however want to make a few tweaks to it, which I hopefully will get around attending to over the next few weeks. I also have my eye on &lt;a href=&#34;https://prtksxna.com/&#34;&gt;Prateek&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/themes/zuari/&#34;&gt;Zuari theme&lt;/a&gt; which is deeply &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;indieweb&lt;/a&gt; compliant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last evening, &lt;a href=&#34;https://atchuth.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Atchuth&lt;/a&gt; mentioned he&amp;rsquo;s now using his RPi4 as a full fledged desktop machine. He&amp;rsquo;s moved over from DietPi to the Raspbian OS. Makes sense given his current use-case. Sharath on the other hand is still using his RPi 4 predominantly as a Nextcloud server.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week has been great in terms of re-connecting with some good old friends! We&amp;rsquo;re planning a re-union sometime next year. 20 year since we finished school! Phew!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Khat-pat makers group that I am part of is now getting more traction and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome just hearing out the cool things that other folks are doing. This week&amp;rsquo;s session was on building drones from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also got around connecting with the kids I taught 10 years ago! They&amp;rsquo;ve all moved on to college and are into various things now. One kid wanted to become a stellar teacher and this  is one of the best messages I&amp;rsquo;ve received so far!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last night we played a few good rounds of Pictionary/Dumb-charades with the kids. Shasta had a terrific time just watching the &amp;lsquo;adults&amp;rsquo; in their elements. You never get too old for this game!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picturing Data: Monocle&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://monocle.com/extensions/monocle/bin/mp3&#34;&gt;https://monocle.com/extensions/monocle/bin/mp3&lt;/a&gt;_downloader.php?file=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/788260468/download/&amp;amp;filename=monocle_on_design_442.mp3&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://termux.com/&#34;&gt;Termux app&lt;/a&gt; has been an amazing value-add to my phone for those quick server check-in&amp;rsquo;s!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/agNcAx&#34;&gt;‘We can’t go back to normal’: How will coronavirus change the world?&lt;/a&gt;: 2020 will be etched in the memories of most people living today as one that drastically changed how we as humans functioned. As Covid19 spreads across various countries, it&amp;rsquo;s influencing and compelling dire actions. What was considered to be impossible at various level, is now just a quick decision point - Financial stimulus, vaccine production, remote work and schooling to name a prominent few. As we build resistance to the virus as a society and consequently as the adrenaline that&amp;rsquo;s currently rampant drains out, we&amp;rsquo;re going to see the fallout&amp;rsquo;s of our actions or several inaction&amp;rsquo;s thereof. Assuming another event of this magnitude does not occur over the next decade, the world is going to need a major overhaul to recover from the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ea2f0cbab1fa1.31532716&#34;&gt;Beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide to PGP&lt;/a&gt;: A simple and easy read on PGP with actionable guidance for non-tech folks out there. It&amp;rsquo;s given that over the next few months most countries are going to erode into the privacy of its citizens. Policies that are brought into effect now for surveillance and tracing will overarchingly become the norm and will be almost impossible to retract. It&amp;rsquo;s critical that we act now to safeguard what little privacy we can. It&amp;rsquo;s never been about - &amp;lsquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing that I have to hide.&amp;rsquo; Ignorance can and will heavily be mis-appropriated for someone else&amp;rsquo;s benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5e9ecbae16ccb0.15652872&#34;&gt;Why one Neuroscientist started blasting his core&lt;/a&gt;: Neural pathways, stress control systems and of course the adrenal medula. Yet another fascinating read on how amazing the human body is!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ea68cce89b171.88947262&#34;&gt;How Saudi Arabia&amp;rsquo;s religious project transformed Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;: Religion, politics and power are so damned intertwined. If anything, its one of those defining necessities and vices of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ea68e112d5251.85133599&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to build&lt;/a&gt;: So beautifully phrased! It&amp;rsquo;s high time we dusted those tarp sheets and get to build from ground-up. Over time we&amp;rsquo;ve become complacent as a society and we need one strong re-boot!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2020/02/29/weeknote-09-ashland-and-taxtime/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks have been pretty &amp;lsquo;choppy&amp;rsquo;. Some recent developments on the work front has gotten us back to Boston. Always wonderful being back here. Looks like New-England has had a pretty mild winter and we&amp;rsquo;re making sure we take Shasta out as much as possible!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple weeks we&amp;rsquo;ll have to make a few interesting decisions. Between grad programs, fellowships and other exciting opportunities; 2020 is already off to a happening start!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tax filing time! I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ec4320d980f38.10621582&#34;&gt;super pissed with TurboTax last year&lt;/a&gt;. This year I helped file taxes for my in-laws using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freefilefillableforms.com/&#34;&gt;FreeFillableForms&lt;/a&gt; option. Found it to be super easy and straight forward. Will most likely use it for my personal taxes too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://darknetdiaries.com/&#34;&gt;Darknet Diaries&lt;/a&gt;: Chanced upon this podcast early this week while sifting through AntennaPod and the premise sounded pretty interesting - Hacking and cyber-warfare. My podcast consumption has drastically come down over the last few months. This will hopefully get me back on the podtrack!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://minetime.ai/&#34;&gt;MineTime&lt;/a&gt; : Think &amp;lsquo;smarter&amp;rsquo; calendars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digikam.org/&#34;&gt;Digikam&lt;/a&gt; : Self hosted photo management with facial recognition! I&amp;rsquo;d probably pair this with my Nextcloud photo library over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ee9d823b05bf0.76779254&#34;&gt;Lifesaving rescue on Mount Washington&lt;/a&gt;: Yet another terrific read from Ty Gagne! Note to self to get that &lt;a href=&#34;https://wildlife.state.nh.us/safe/&#34;&gt;HikeSafe card&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/eDqTtT&#34;&gt;Talking to youth about privacy, security and digital spaces&lt;/a&gt;: Wonderful piece, Ian. Loved the concept of identifying an &amp;lsquo;approach point&amp;rsquo;. Most of what he mentioned also applies to adults and more so elderly parents who&amp;rsquo;ve jumped on the digital scene without much awareness on the privacy implications!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/ustEXp&#34;&gt;The medications that change who we are&lt;/a&gt;: Not quite surprising but pretty intriguing read on how dependent we&amp;rsquo;re on medication these days. Think twice before you pop that pill!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/mBnzcp&#34;&gt;Why Astrology matters&lt;/a&gt;: My family (prior generation) was (is?) a strong believer in Astrology. From making birth charts/Horoscopes, wearing different rings on the fingers to influence the &amp;lsquo;stars&amp;rsquo;, matching horoscopes prior to weddings, and most significantly to pick an auspicious time to travel; The sentiment has definitely changed over the last decade or so, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s still there!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Astrology has stood the test of several hundred generations now and there&amp;rsquo;s got to be an iota of truth somewhere out there. That said, I still have an excruciatingly hard time believing that the stars and planets have anything to do with one&amp;rsquo;s life developments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ee9d85ebfadf0.97957728&#34;&gt;Opinion | We’re Banning Facial Recognition. We’re Missing the Point.&lt;/a&gt;: It all boils down to regulation. Or technology that&amp;rsquo;s able to shroud a person&amp;rsquo;s exteriors both physically, electrically and magnetically!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally got around installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://pixel.srkn.org/sriperinkulam&#34;&gt;PixelFed&lt;/a&gt; on a Hetzner server. Absolutely love it! It&amp;rsquo;s truly an Instagram clone sans the tracking. The lead developer has some interesting updates up his sleeve and I am very keen to see how this project shapes up as it evolves out of beta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meena suggested Nik and I work on the 3D puzzle Nik&amp;rsquo;s had for quite sometime now. Worked on it till about 0200 the next day morning and finished setting up this beautiful musical box puzzle. The engineering could have been a bit more nuanced. However, had a terrific time working on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Managed to fit in a short 4.5mile hike along the Thru trail in Patapsco State Park. With dusk setting in and absolutely nobody else on the trail, it did feel a bit spooky being out there. Spotted a few Deers and a fox on the way back. The old Woodstock bar and the huge empty parking lot for the trail right beside the railway line was probably something that added to the eeriness of the evening!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki_(2012_film)&#34;&gt;Kon-Tiki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lighthouse_of_the_Orcas&#34;&gt;The Lighthouse of the Orcas&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I helped Sharath setup a nextcloud instance on the RaspberryPi 4 that we got him for Christmas. Installed the DietPi OS, moved the user data over to a 5TB WD disk and while at it also setup a pi-hole for the network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weather wise, this was one odd week. Had a good dusting of snow on Tuesday night and a balmy 60 degrees for most of the weekend. The kids had early school closures and we made sure we hit the trails.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gone are the crawling days. Shasta has moved on to walking and she&amp;rsquo;s getting pretty good at it. Also her mischief quotient is raising by the day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meena found an interesting course in Tufts and has applied for the 2020 Fall deadline. Fingers crossed that she makes it! Some other exciting developments through this week might take us back to Boston this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Indicator from Planet Money: The Skyrocketing Cost Of Air Ambulances&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.podtrac.com/npr-510325/edge1.pod.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/indicator/2020/01/20200103&#34;&gt;https://play.podtrac.com/npr-510325/edge1.pod.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/indicator/2020/01/20200103&lt;/a&gt;_indicator_200103_air_ambulances_final.mp3&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/XDFmDn&#34;&gt;Welcome to New Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;: Netflix has absolutely taken over the digital market. Oddly they rely on AWS!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/04/why-parents-are-addicted-to-calpol&#34;&gt;Why parents are addicted to Calpol&lt;/a&gt;: So true! It struck me so starkly when we moved to the states several years back. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how quickly my family pops in paracetamols without any second thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/3FULea&#34;&gt;The Shadow Commander&lt;/a&gt;: Quite an interesting read on recent developments in Iran and it&amp;rsquo;s past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Convincing their parents last minute, Divyaa and Raaghuv drove up to Maryland with us. The kids had a ball of a time in the last row of the Sienna. We stopped over at Durham for the night and met Uncle Lou the next day for breakfast. Of course also visited Fuqua school of Business. Rajesh graduated from here and we so wished he was alive to show us around this campus. A gentle reminder to check-in with everyone near and dear every once in a while&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meena and I took the kids Skiing at Liberty on Thursday night. This has become more of a tradition now at year-end(beginning). A first for Raaghuv and Divyaa though. Just before we left, the boys decided to take on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libertymountainresort.com/interactive-map#close&#34;&gt;Lower blue streak&lt;/a&gt;, and I joined them. Absolutely reminded me of my first day at skiing! Need to work on that nuanced braking!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh and of course, Happy New Year! Last year I chose to be a bit more free, a privilege I am so glad I had and thankful for. Looking forward to what we chart in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Listening to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://genius.com/Maroon-5-memories-lyrics&#34;&gt;Memories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The great American tax haven: why the super-rich love South Dakota&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Episode 216: How Four Drinking Buddies Saved Brazil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34;&gt;OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt;: Video recording and live-streaming&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/EtuykY&#34;&gt;Why more kids are learning — and enjoying — yoga&lt;/a&gt;: While yoga has become a fad now in the western world, I&amp;rsquo;d go further out to expand it to any activity that gets them out of a &amp;lsquo;controlled&amp;rsquo; space. My dream classroom would be one out in the open with minimal teacher intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/sBdxWP&#34;&gt;Why the French Don’t Show Excitement&lt;/a&gt;: While I like the idea of “&lt;em&gt;on est bien, là&lt;/em&gt;”, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a tough time getting that perceived cold shoulder in response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/eHNn4g&#34;&gt;‘For five years we dreaded every meal’: my infant son’s struggle with food&lt;/a&gt;: They&amp;rsquo;re just so many things that could go wrong&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful Meena and Shasta are doing terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/krJguV&#34;&gt;Don’t just criticise the police. They’re constrained&lt;/a&gt;: As the world&amp;rsquo;s largest democracy comes to grips with the weight of the existence of more than a billion people, more so now as the youth are engaging and reacting to state and national politics, It&amp;rsquo;s key that funding and training is adequately increased to maintain law and order. And then there&amp;rsquo;s corruption to deal with&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The drive down to Florida was pretty uneventful. But for some holiday traffic near Virginia, we had a pretty smooth drive, clocking about 15 hours in total.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A random talk with a runner at the Baseline trail coaxed us to run a longer distance the next day. Got the four kids and Sharath onboard too. Well, the kids decided to sleep-in on Sunday, while Sharath and I head out to the trail. Realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t carry cash, so we decided to run unsupported. Running conditions were just right with a good blend of drizzle and rain. The beauty of winter is that you can cover so many more miles in the dark! Was mostly helping Sharath pace and finish within 3 hours. Wrapped up with 14.5 miles under his belt. Not a bad way to close out the year!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A week packed with hikes almost every day of the week and a lot of downtime with family. The girls convinced their moms to get extra ear piercings and Nikhil rode the wagon and got one for himself too!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://convos.by/&#34;&gt;Convos&lt;/a&gt;: IRC based multi-user chat application&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/2GhBPn&#34;&gt;Colleges are turning students’ phones into surveillance machines, tracking the locations of hundreds of thousands&lt;/a&gt;: Thank you, but no thank you! &amp;lsquo;Tracking you for your own good&amp;rsquo; - Isn&amp;rsquo;t that where it all starts going downhill?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/gawvRZ&#34;&gt;20,000 ft under the sea&lt;/a&gt;: Mining, exploring and ofcourse polluting.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/IMG-20191219-WA0021.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Got a RaspberryPi 4 kit for my eldest brother. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to set up a homeserver for him. On my nudging, the second eldest, setup a homeserver sometime back and we&amp;rsquo;re very impressed with the speed and crisp loading of the photos he&amp;rsquo;s currently hosting on a nextcloud setup. On a similar vein, I&amp;rsquo;m testing the cloud provider Hertzner. They&amp;rsquo;re super cheap and seem to be pretty good. Will probably port over my services from Digital Ocean over the next few months if I find them stable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was wonderful to see Nik perform in his year-end winter performance. The group sounded way professional! Also, Nancy had her track meet yesterday. She&amp;rsquo;s improved her pace a lot over the last year and it&amp;rsquo;s wonderful seeing her truly enjoy running.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We decided to have an early christmas gift exchange with the Baltimore family before we hit the road for Florida. Initial plan was to leave early on Saturday morning and reach Miss Bama&amp;rsquo;s home by the evening. As luck would have it, we noticed last night that we had to change the catalytic converter in the Sienna. Got that fixed first thing today at Firestone. Will now head down south, contingent on weather and traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/cLEJea&#34;&gt;Ghost ships, crop circles, and soft gold: A GPS mystery in Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;: GPS spoofing taken to a whole new level.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We performed Shasta&amp;rsquo;s Ayusha homam last weekend. Both Meena and I were inclined that athimber - a super role model in the family perform it. Athimber and Appa recited the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vak1969.com/2013/02/01/introduction-to-rudram/&#34;&gt;Rudram&lt;/a&gt; 11 times prior to the actual homam. Coincidentally, It was also Appa&amp;rsquo;s 83rd and Adi&amp;rsquo;s 2nd birthday! Aparna flew in from Florida and the rest of the family drove down from CT and NJ. We&amp;rsquo;re extremely appreciative that they could all make it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also got Shasta&amp;rsquo;s ears pierced this week. Remarkably, she it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite seem to bother her much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I turned 34 this 12th. Meena made some delicious food and as always, we kept it super low-key. I&amp;rsquo;ve been eyeing the smaller version of the REI Nalgene bottle for a while now. We stopped by at the REI store in Catonsville and picked one up. Sharath and Manni surprised me with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/HdccHE&#34;&gt;Garmin Forerunner 235&lt;/a&gt;! Probably a silent nudge to get me back to running. The Garmin forerunner 305 that they gifted me 9 years back is still super functional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later today we head to NJ for Adi&amp;rsquo;s ayush homam!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/&#34;&gt;Outline&lt;/a&gt;: De-clutter, read and annotate articles&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://darebee.com/&#34;&gt;Darbee&lt;/a&gt;: A fascinating free fitness resource with well depicted illustrations, programs, videos, manuals and individual workouts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/ahpCgT&#34;&gt;I Worked at Capital One for Five Years.
