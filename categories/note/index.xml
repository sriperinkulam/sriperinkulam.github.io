The NUC, RPi NCP, Odroid and routers all now sit neatly in one space. The sliding shelves are an added bonus and the open back and sides give a lot of space for air circulation and cable management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We opened gifts a couple days early this year since S&amp;rsquo;&amp;amp;A/Bonn were heading out to Merida on the 24th. Last night, S set aside cookies (that she&amp;rsquo;d baked), milk and carrots for Santa and the reindeers. Early this morning, she was beaming with joy the moment she noticed Santa had indeed taken a few cookies and carrots. As she sparkled-eye opened the Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza card game that M had packed last night as Santa&amp;rsquo;s gift, it was evident she was consumed by the &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; that was Santa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very good friend mentioned couple years ago to keep the magic element alive in her for as far as possible. This morning that poignant statement flashed in my mind as I saw this 5 year old experiencing pure naive joy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be naughty and be nice - You never know what gleaming rewards could come of it. Wish you a Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Franconia Ridge Hike</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2017/07/26/franconia-ridge-hike/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ssphugo@srkn.anonaddy.com (Srikanth Perinkulam)</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime around midnight we reach a bridge with one side of its&amp;rsquo; railing non-existent. I sprint ahead and heave a sigh of relief when I notice the &amp;lsquo;Old Bridle trail&amp;rsquo;[OBT] signboard high up on a tree. This confirms this is &amp;rsquo;the&amp;rsquo; bridge that we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking out for, for the past few hours and that the trail head should be a few hundred feet away. Meena suggests Jyothsna and I shoot ahead while she and Sanjana would follow behind slowly. With just one headlamp we make our way as fast as possible to the Lafayette camping ground parking lot. As we turn round the corner, we hear a concerned and loud &amp;lsquo;PS, PS?&amp;rsquo; cry. I&amp;rsquo;m relieved to hear Praveen&amp;rsquo;s voice and as soon he checks all four of us are safe he drops the bomb-shell. Having reached the trail head around 6pm and not hearing from us since then, he apparently had called in a search and rescue operation for us about 30 minutes back. My excitement on &amp;lsquo;finishing&amp;rsquo; the hike is short lived as I think to myself - &amp;lsquo;This is not over yet&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;. The last 20 hours have been draining, mentally more than physically. What should have been a decent eight hour hike has gone way beyond my initial estimation. Over the rest of Sunday, as we let everything sink in, Meena and I continue to hash out what possibly could have led up to this and what we should do to avoid this from recurring in future hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/IMG_4813-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plan was to take a quick break at the AMC Greenleaf hut [4200&amp;rsquo;] that was 2.9 mi from the parking lot [1780&amp;rsquo;] and then summit Mt. Lafayette [5260&amp;rsquo;] that was 1.1mi from here. From there on we&amp;rsquo;d hit the Franconia ridge trail to reach Little Haystack[4760&amp;rsquo;] summit via Mt. Lincoln [5060&amp;rsquo;]. To close out the 9 mi loop we&amp;rsquo;d eventually take the &amp;lsquo;Falling waters trail&amp;rsquo;[FWT] from Little Haystack to the parking lot that&amp;rsquo;s about 3.2 mi mostly downhill. On average it should take about 7 hours to finish this 8.9 mile loop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the prime reasons&amp;rsquo; for us to leave Boston this early was to make sure we had ample time to cover the ridge and get back prior to night fall. As we trudged our way up the OBT, Praveen seemed to have significant difficulty keeping up. As we gained elevation and the vistas opened up, we stopped quite a few times on the way. Knowing we had time at our disposal, we decided to slow down the pace and finally reached the AMC Greenleaf hut around 12:45pm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/IMG_4833-768x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A longish break here and we hit the 1.1mi Greenleaf trail to summit Mt. Lafayette. The weather was just right and the wind and thin air seemed to lighten things a bit. Going with the flow, Meena and I had an amazing time running up the trail. Later after waiting for close to 20 minutes, I urged Meena to head up to the summit while I head back down to check on the other folks. I finally see them a few hundred feet below and ran down the trail to see if they needed any help. Praveen apparently did not want to proceed further and felt more comfortable heading back. I nudged him a bit to reconsider his choice and realised he&amp;rsquo;d already made up his mind. The question now was should I get the whole group down or just let him head back while we finished the loop.Â &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/IMG_4831-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA; Jyothsna was in two minds, while Sanjana seemed determined to complete the loop. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite concerned with Praveen getting back to the parking lot safely. He knew the trail now, had time at his disposal and could always pick up some replenishment&amp;rsquo;s from the hut. Also in the rare situation that he needed help, there were quite a few folks doing the reverse loop. The decision was made. I handed back his coat and gave him my headlamp and whistle just in case he doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it before nightfall. The three of us make our way up to the Mt. Lafayette summit and catch up with Meena who&amp;rsquo;s already been here for close to 30 minutes now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We soon leave Mt Lafayette and hit the ridge trail to make our way down south to Little Haystack. The ridge between Mt Lafayette and Mt. Lincoln had some technical downhills. This stretch would probably be a bit tricky had the weather worsened but gives some astounding views of the White mountains and the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The elevation, views and weather conditions remind me of the western ghats back in India. It hits me real hard that this is the first significant (comparable in terms of elevation profile) hike I&amp;rsquo;ve done since leaving India four years ago and rekindles some good old memories!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/14c4e068-ba7d-4672-a78e-c510269e2ea8-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meena and I run down the ridge and wait for Jyothsna and Sanjana to catch-up. Sanjana seems to be having some issues with her toes and isn&amp;rsquo;t quite able to keep pace. We finally make it to Little Haystack around 05:30pm. Quite aware that we still had 3.2 mi to cover to make our way back to the parking lot, we quickly grab some sandwiches and hit the FWT.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could see the parking lot from Haystack but going by the current pace looked like we&amp;rsquo;d make it there only around 10:00pm. Sanjana&amp;rsquo;s phone seemed to have some reception and we sent Praveen a quick voice and regular message mentioning our ETA. Sanjana&amp;rsquo;s toes&amp;rsquo; weren&amp;rsquo;t getting any better and the steep downhill on the rocky trail made things worse. The likelihood of us getting to the falls before nightfall was pretty low but we really wanted to give that a good shot. With two headlamps and a decent supply of water we slowly made our way downhill. &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/d5b9916f-b267-400a-a94b-53cc8a2289ce-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;Things went down south once it got dark. Jyothsna started getting ancy about Praveen and with reduced light, our pace reduced drastically. With close to 12 hours on foot and the end never seeming near, morale was extremely low. The barely visible dark blue trail markers on the trees made things worse. At several locations, I had to go ahead to make sure we were on the right path and then head back to re-group and follow the trail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like eternity, we finally heard some water gurgling. Though this meant we were nearing the intersection where the OBT and the FWT merged, it added some more complexity. The FWT had quite a few switch-backs getting us to cross the river stream several times from bank to bank. Meena mentioned another hiker warned her of this while on the ridge. The rocks were slippery and the access points a bit tricky to maneuver in the dark. Had it not been for the thought that Praveen would be waiting for us (hopefully) at the parking lot, I would have voted camping at the river bed till dawn break.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At around 11:30pm we finally come across two other hikers coming from the opposite direction. They tell us the parking lot is about 45 minutes away. With some renewed energy (and no other option!) we finally make it to &amp;rsquo;the&amp;rsquo; bridge and eventually to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Praveen gives us a low-down of his search and rescue alarm. Apparently he never received the message we sent him. As we try to call the police to try and get them to stall any initiated attempts, a NH Fish and game law enforcement vehicle drives in to the parking lot. The officer checks if everyone is safe and injury free and then radio&amp;rsquo;s in to the search party that we&amp;rsquo;re safe. After some formal procedures and protocols he mentions&amp;rsquo; we&amp;rsquo;re good to head back home and will hear from them later if required. We head back towards Boston and finally reach home around 05:30am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meena and I keep discussing and reliving the last several hours over the rest of the day. We figured we had to come up with measures to avoid this from recurring in future group hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the hike: [x] Share emergency contacts and communication protocols. [x] Apprise each team member of individual medical needs. [x] Share hike details [Terrain, directions, landmarks, routes etc] with each team member. [x] Check on each members prior experience with the difficulty and endurance level of the hike. [x] Check on mandatory equipment - Headlamps, tents, Sleeping gear etc. [x] Set time and distance checkpoints to determine turn-around points if necessary. [x] Determine team break-out protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When looking back at the hike this weekend, I could easily see the stark failure-points right from the start. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of anyone&amp;rsquo;s general fitness levels. I did not collect and share emergency medical and contact information. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a communication protocol. We should have taken a realty check at the Greenleaf hut for distance and pace. I should not have left Praveen head back alone. Most importantly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a plan B!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing ALL of the above while organizing hikes for HydVentura. This hike would remain truly memorable not just for the splendid ridge-line views but for the gross failures at several levels in organizing it. Despite the shortcomings, I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at how each one handled the situation they were thrown in. Praveen was rational enough to turn around when he knew his body couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the stress physically. After an initial breakdown, Jyothsna kept her calm as we maneuvered the trails and falls in the dark. Sanjana kept going despite being in deep pain and tried her best to keep up with us as we pushed ahead. Meena was impeccable in keeping the group morale high and playing lead-sweep seamlessly as and when needed. Things could have been way difficult had even one of us buckled down&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a 5 year hiatus of organizing long distance hikes for big groups, it feels good to be back in this space. This hike would remain etched as a classic realty check. Looking forward to the Mt. Washington hike later this weekend. And now we know what not to do!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/cropped-cropped-SP01-550afdebv1_site_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com&#34;&gt;Srikanth Perinkulam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Realized today that a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/06/30/squashing-the-bug/&#34;&gt;code fix&lt;/a&gt; that I had implemented sometime back, inadvertently introduced a minor bug in my workflow. Will have to get around fixing this sometime later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On another note, I decided to temporarily suspend my self-hosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://freshrss.org/&#34;&gt;freshRSS&lt;/a&gt; installation and moved my feeds to &lt;a href=&#34;https://theoldreader.com/&#34;&gt;The Old Reader&lt;/a&gt;. Currently I don&amp;rsquo;t see a huge benefit of self hosting it unless I&amp;rsquo;m able to implement responding directly from that interface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/cropped-cropped-SP01-550afdebv1_site_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com&#34;&gt;Srikanth Perinkulam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Memories</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get into my house, I believe from the side entrance. Looks like there&amp;rsquo;s nobody in there. It&amp;rsquo;s mildly windy. Possibly from an open window? There&amp;rsquo;s a barely audible calming music from MS coming out from the bedroom. As I walk in, I notice TVM in the bed cocooned in a blanket, her eye&amp;rsquo;s glazed and probing deep in thought. I gently tap her and ask her if everything&amp;rsquo;s okay. She turns around and I somehow know she&amp;rsquo;s thinking of Amma. Tears well up in her eyes as she asks if we did everything we could. I&amp;rsquo;m petrified. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an answer for her and I&amp;rsquo;m left standing there for a seemingly long time&amp;hellip; All of a sudden I notice someone trying to open the window mesh and get the keys from the inside. Atchuth? I open the main door and see Nikhil, Sharath, Aparna and a few other kids. They say they&amp;rsquo;re back from Brueggers. I come back to the bedroom to check on TVM. She&amp;rsquo;s smiling as if nothing in the past really happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wait. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense. There&amp;rsquo;s no Brueggers in Habsiguda. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a Brueggers myself. This can&amp;rsquo;t be real. I turn around and realize it&amp;rsquo;s 04:40am. Hop off the bed, into my yoga clothes and head to the kitchen. I&amp;rsquo;m insanely awake and fresh. As I work on different tasks in the kitchen the dream keeps playing in my mind&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Miss Me has long been saying I should write more about Amma. Unfortunately, most of my memories now only seem to be from her last few years in the hospital. Times mostly dabbled with pain&amp;hellip;I barely recollect any memories of me growing up with her around. Memories need triggers and someday hopefully when they kick in, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to recollect more of the good times I spent with her&amp;hellip;If only I could get those back, I&amp;rsquo;d treasure them for life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/cropped-cropped-SP01-550afdebv1_site_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com&#34;&gt;Srikanth Perinkulam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Hyannis notes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2017/07/07/hyannis-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ssphugo@srkn.anonaddy.com (Srikanth Perinkulam)</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2017/07/07/hyannis-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An early morning drive to Hyannis (almost) and back. Just that Miss Me did not hop on the ferry and decided to head home with me. She was to volunteer at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nantucketyogafestival.com/&#34;&gt;Nantucket Yoga festival&lt;/a&gt; which she attended last year and had a real good time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today morning she just didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; like being there and we decided to head back. Staying back should also give her more time to spend with Shebs as she prepares for her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/1105078.html&#34;&gt;upcoming ICC matches&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a busy few weeks ahead and this weekend is most likely the only one, that the girls get to spend time together for some time to come now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early this year Miss Me and I committed to not doing activities unless we truly and really want to do it. A conscious effort to spend more quality time taking part in different things that enrich our experiences rather than &amp;lsquo;going with the flow&amp;rsquo; and letting things &amp;lsquo;bloat&amp;rsquo; our weekend calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On that note, we have some pretty exciting weekends coming up. Later today I&amp;rsquo;d be driving over with my cousins to the Poconos for a good long session of white water rafting. Back to the frothy waters &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2008/06/14/kundalika-white-water-rafting/&#34;&gt;after 9 years&lt;/a&gt;. Pretty excited! Next weekend I plan to volunteer and/or pace overnight at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vermont100.com/&#34;&gt;Vermont 100mile run&lt;/a&gt;. Last year while volunteering at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vermont100.com/interview-camp-ten-bear-aid-station-captains/&#34;&gt;Camp 10 Bear&lt;/a&gt;, I ended up pacing a runner who had lost his pacer. With the heavy thunderstorm, pitch black darkness and my first time pacing, I was absolutely blown away that night. In several ways, that experience transformed my outlook towards running long distances and sub-consciously pushed me to train for a 50 miler. This year we&amp;rsquo;d also be taking over some delicious vegan blondies for the runners. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait! For the July 22nd weekend we plan to hike the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-hampshire/mount-lafayette-and-franconia-ridge-trail-loop&#34;&gt;Franconia ridge trail&lt;/a&gt; with a few friends from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.teachforindia.org/&#34;&gt;TFI&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere. This one is an attempt to dive back into my hiking endeavors. I miss those days of organizing hikes for big groups and so badly want to get back to it. Later this year, a trip to Acadia, a visit to at least one national park in Canada and long day hikes in and around the White Mountains is something that&amp;rsquo;s on the cards too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ten years back I was a maniac putting in long hours during weekdays just so I could keep my weekends free to explore the trails out there. Something that truly kept me going! I think I&amp;rsquo;m back to doing that now. Just that there&amp;rsquo;s a much better balance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/cropped-cropped-SP01-550afdebv1_site_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com&#34;&gt;Srikanth Perinkulam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/favorite?tweet_id=883363130440593408&#34;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?tweet_id=883363130440593408&#34;&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=883363130440593408&#34;&gt;repost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Squashing the bug</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Squashed a minor bug in my code for &amp;lsquo;favorite&amp;rsquo; posts. The post wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting marked up with Microformats when the content (response) was blank.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way it&amp;rsquo;s currently setup, I have just one workflow for all &amp;rsquo;types&amp;rsquo; of post (podcast, reply, like, repost, bookmark, read etc.) and looks like I missed a logic flow that &amp;rsquo;like&amp;rsquo; posts may not necessarily have a note from me. A quick conditional check and the workflow works like a charm!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/cropped-cropped-SP01-550afdebv1_site_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com&#34;&gt;Srikanth Perinkulam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
