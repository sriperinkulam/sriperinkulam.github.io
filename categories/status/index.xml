      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a roll today! Also digitized our &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/coin&#34;&gt;coin collection&lt;/a&gt;. This was so much fun putting together!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;25 years ago, I was much into collecting stamps. Somewhere along the road that kinda stagnated. Moved over that digitized collection to this portal &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/map&#34;&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; page to reflect posts that have a set location. Currently this is a super vanilla layout and I think I should cluster these by region. I do like how it&amp;rsquo;s turned out though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at it, I realised I missed downloading pictures from my old Flickr account to Nextcloud. Brought those in and nuked the Flickr account. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/03/maps/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d initially planned on visiting HongKong to celebrate Patti&amp;rsquo;s 80th and then head to India for a short trip for our R&amp;amp;R. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/04/stented/&#34;&gt;Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s heart decided nah-ah&lt;/a&gt; and we ended up in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/dubai&#34;&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/pune/&#34;&gt;Visiting Pune&lt;/a&gt; was most fulfilling. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ahmedabad&#34;&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/trivandrum&#34;&gt;Trivandrum&lt;/a&gt; to meet Raju Mama. Drive to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ernakulam&#34;&gt;Ernakulam&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/bangalore&#34;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; but the flying &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/madras&#34;&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; trip was one last minute surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&amp;rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a weird feeling. To not be presence-aware of someone 24x7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, S had either been with both M and I or just M when I travel for work. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to be with just S alone for a long stretch. Until last week. M&amp;amp;I thought it might be a good idea for her to travel with me from Dubai. It felt like she matured all of a sudden during Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s hospitalization. Maybe she sensed the stress all around her and adapted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As S traveled with me, zipping across 6 cities, I felt I was constantly on the hook. How much buffer time do I need to get her ready? Did she use the bathroom before we head out? Did I keep a spare set of clothes with me? Will I find the food that she might like in the new place? If not, did I have enough snack options for her? Do I need to get her clothes washed in this city or the next? Which PJ set would she like tonight? How do I coax her to sleep despite all the flux around her? What am I forgetting?&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to not do that, now that she isn&amp;rsquo;t with me, It feels odd. And then, when it actually dawns that M&amp;rsquo;s doing this more or less 24x7x365 - besides the gazillion other things she does; I think the least I can do is get involved a lot more.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got an official notification confirming that I was tenured a
month ago. Yay! Pleasantly surprised. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mean much, I guess, under the current administration. The recent RIF plans don&amp;rsquo;t quite bode well for domestic folks and rumor is that overseas positions are up next. Should have more clarity over the next few days. All I need though is just a few more weeks to clock in those three years and get the whole benefit of the TSP.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To the recent air-crash. To the Iran-Israel escalation. To the Israel-Palestine conflict. To the massive layoffs happening all over the federal space. To the incessant pollution on the roads. To the mindless spending all over. To the massive disparity across realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking over to &lt;em&gt;Masks&lt;/em&gt; for a couple drinks and that falafel burger. Playing &lt;em&gt;Breath of the WIld&lt;/em&gt; like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. Debating pros and cons of a neuro program in UCL. Ordering multiple T1000Es to tinker with. Planning future travel across waters. Living in this messed up world, raising a kid just like those gazillion out there who&amp;rsquo;re going to wonder what the heck their parents and ancestors did and did&amp;rsquo;nt do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this does not compute. Numb at so many levels&amp;hellip;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took an armored Land Cruiser out for a spin here on the hills and some dirt roads. SO MUCH FUN! It&amp;rsquo;s been several years that I&amp;rsquo;ve driven a stick-shift. Amazing how muscle memory just works.
