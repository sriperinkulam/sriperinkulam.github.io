      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my list of â€˜things to sortâ€™ is a bunch of files and physical documents that we&amp;rsquo;re compelled to move from place to place as we relocate every few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering getting a document scanner to digest these files digitally and get rid of them. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind for a few years now and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve reached that decision threshold to bite the bullet and get a scanner. Now these devices run anywhere between 200 and 600 USD that I am NOT interested in spending for this indulgence. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely hunt for one on ebay or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.backmarket.com/&#34;&gt;backmarket&lt;/a&gt; sticking to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/uses&#34;&gt;recycled hardware whenever feasible&lt;/a&gt; stand. The &lt;em&gt;Fujitsu Fi 6130&lt;/em&gt; seems to fit that &amp;lsquo;cheap and best&amp;rsquo;  bucket if sourced second hand. They seem to be selling for about 70 USD.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switched off my phone from airplane mode first thing this morning to check on the &amp;lsquo;Shutdown&amp;rsquo; status and as expected congress did fail to secure those 60 votes. Also received a couple emails mentioning my position was &lt;em&gt;non-excepted&lt;/em&gt; and hence I was effectively furloughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Received another email around 2200 stating my position is now considered &lt;em&gt;excepted&lt;/em&gt; and I need to report back to work the next working day. Alrighty, we&amp;rsquo;re back in business. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/01/furloughed/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/uses&#34;&gt;uses&lt;/a&gt; page on my portal. Whoa. Adds up to almost 2500 USD. Agreed, that&amp;rsquo;s over several years but still! And, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t even include &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the gadgets I physically have! Wonder what a typical person spends on gadgets over a decade? How much do you spend? &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/12/uses/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL Syncthing has an option to &amp;lsquo;ignore delete&amp;rsquo; in its advanced settings. Suepr neat! This simplifies posting images from the phone and lets me &amp;lsquo;declutter&amp;rsquo; the phone super fast. Likey, likey! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/21/ignore-delete/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a roll today! Also digitized our &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/coin&#34;&gt;coin collection&lt;/a&gt;. This was so much fun putting together!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;25 years ago, I was much into collecting stamps. Somewhere along the road that kinda stagnated. Moved over that digitized collection to this portal &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/map&#34;&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; page to reflect posts that have a set location. Currently this is a super vanilla layout and I think I should cluster these by region. I do like how it&amp;rsquo;s turned out though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at it, I realised I missed downloading pictures from my old Flickr account to Nextcloud. Brought those in and nuked the Flickr account. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/03/maps/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d initially planned on visiting HongKong to celebrate Patti&amp;rsquo;s 80th and then head to India for a short trip for our R&amp;amp;R. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/04/stented/&#34;&gt;Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s heart decided nah-ah&lt;/a&gt; and we ended up in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/dubai&#34;&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/pune/&#34;&gt;Visiting Pune&lt;/a&gt; was most fulfilling. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ahmedabad&#34;&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/trivandrum&#34;&gt;Trivandrum&lt;/a&gt; to meet Raju Mama. Drive to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ernakulam&#34;&gt;Ernakulam&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/bangalore&#34;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; but the flying &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/madras&#34;&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; trip was one last minute surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&amp;rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!
