      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d initially planned on visiting HongKong to celebrate Patti&amp;rsquo;s 80th and then head to India for a short trip for our R&amp;amp;R. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/04/stented/&#34;&gt;Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s heart decided nah-ah&lt;/a&gt; and we ended up in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/dubai&#34;&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/pune/&#34;&gt;Visiting Pune&lt;/a&gt; was most fulfilling. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ahmedabad&#34;&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/trivandrum&#34;&gt;Trivandrum&lt;/a&gt; to meet Raju Mama. Drive to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ernakulam&#34;&gt;Ernakulam&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/bangalore&#34;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; but the flying &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/madras&#34;&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; trip was one last minute surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&amp;rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got an official notification confirming that I was tenured a
month ago. Yay! Pleasantly surprised. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mean much, I guess, under the current administration. The recent RIF plans don&amp;rsquo;t quite bode well for domestic folks and rumor is that overseas positions are up next. Should have more clarity over the next few days. All I need though is just a few more weeks to clock in those three years and get the whole benefit of the TSP.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To the recent air-crash. To the Iran-Israel escalation. To the Israel-Palestine conflict. To the massive layoffs happening all over the federal space. To the incessant pollution on the roads. To the mindless spending all over. To the massive disparity across realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking over to &lt;em&gt;Masks&lt;/em&gt; for a couple drinks and that falafel burger. Playing &lt;em&gt;Breath of the WIld&lt;/em&gt; like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. Debating pros and cons of a neuro program in UCL. Ordering multiple T1000Es to tinker with. Planning future travel across waters. Living in this messed up world, raising a kid just like those gazillion out there who&amp;rsquo;re going to wonder what the heck their parents and ancestors did and did&amp;rsquo;nt do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this does not compute. Numb at so many levels&amp;hellip;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took an armored Land Cruiser out for a spin here on the hills and some dirt roads. SO MUCH FUN! It&amp;rsquo;s been several years that I&amp;rsquo;ve driven a stick-shift. Amazing how muscle memory just works.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://withknown.com/&#34;&gt;WithKnown&lt;/a&gt; for about a minute several years ago. Loved the interface and software but it never really stood the test of time. Yesterday, while searching for older posts related to Uganda, I realized, I never quite moved those posts over. Spent about an hour yesterday and migrated those over to this portal. While at it, I also migrated my old twitter posts over. And with that I think all content is now present on this portal. Since the feed settings are limited to 10 most recent posts, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t spam the RSS feeds.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think I almost figured out how to have different feeds for tags and categories in Hugo! Modified the feed so the title is replaced with the publish date instead so feed readers display the content properly instead of just the title and a link to the post. Might still have a few kinks but I think we&amp;rsquo;re slowly getting there&amp;hellip;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was supposed to be a &amp;lsquo;Bridged&amp;rsquo; holiday. In this part of the world, the president apparently declares certain days to be holidays if they happen to fall adjacent to a previously declared public holiday and the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tomorrow being Cameroon day, rumor was that today would be one of those bridged holidays. Sadly it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Locally employed staff were definitely not happy. The Ambo did declare a 59 minute early release. Got the message while we were amidst a small project and not quite at a good stopping point. So we chugged along and head home when we were done. Will take it in spirit though. Merci Beaucoup! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/19/unbridged/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back from a work trip in Malabo. Got there last Thursday and worked through the weekend. We completed a minor site upgrade and completed almost all of the planned work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to explore any of the island since we were mostly shuttling back and forth from work. From what little I did get to see though, this place is beautiful. Between China&amp;rsquo;s belt and road initiative and the island&amp;rsquo;s oil money from the 90s, Infrastructure looked to be quite top notch. The airport terminal is quite spiffy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food was mediocre at best. The Magno hotel has a decent restaurant. Next time I&amp;rsquo;m here I should probably come over the weekend to explore the cafe&amp;rsquo;s and the boardwalk a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ~230 Ft towering Ceiba tree in the embassy compound is a terrific sight. Apparently this tree is quite prevalent all across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet in the hotel was barely functional - for call&amp;rsquo;s atleast. Looks like some port-blocking was definitely at play. Not having those daily calls back home maybe also made the trip feel a bit longer that it actually was? Need to go better prepared next time!
