      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL certain watches &amp;lsquo;skip seconds&amp;rsquo; to conserve battery and to indicate that they are almost out of charge. Noticed this in my Fossil watch a few weeks ago and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother finding out why. Today, it went dead and only then did I connect the dots! Super neat! Skip a second, warn but still keep time. This is similar to a vehicle&amp;rsquo;s indicator light flashing quicker when the bulb&amp;rsquo;s blown. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/25/skipping-seconds/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally got around adding an &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/about&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page on this site. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it took my twenty years for this! Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks into the shutdown and neither party seems to be in a rush to sort this out. Thankfully we have decent savings. Also does help that the state department has always paid two weeks late. This paycheck should be about 70% my regular paycheck accounting for work done until Sep 30th. There&amp;rsquo;s talk of this shutdown maybe making it to Thanksgiving. Historically, they&amp;rsquo;ve responded when ATC / TSA folks threw in their towels&amp;hellip;This time around might be different though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M wants to go to London with S. Thinking we should be able to absorb that cost. And then there&amp;rsquo;s the Virginia trip. Might be a pricey end of the year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the work front, looks like that Malabo trip is gonna happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon had its elections last sunday and Issa Tchiroma unilaterally declared victory today. Something that the Constitutional Council said would be considered &amp;lsquo;High treason&amp;rsquo;. They made it so far with very little unrest. Next few weeks though portends to be interesting! The worlds&amp;rsquo; oldest and longest serving president might not be all so benevolent after all.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/14/travel-and-drama/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my list of â€˜things to sortâ€™ is a bunch of files and physical documents that we&amp;rsquo;re compelled to move from place to place as we relocate every few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering getting a document scanner to digest these files digitally and get rid of them. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind for a few years now and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve reached that decision threshold to bite the bullet and get a scanner. Now these devices run anywhere between 200 and 600 USD that I am NOT interested in spending for this indulgence. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely hunt for one on ebay or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.backmarket.com/&#34;&gt;backmarket&lt;/a&gt; sticking to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/uses&#34;&gt;recycled hardware whenever feasible&lt;/a&gt; stand. The &lt;em&gt;Fujitsu Fi 6130&lt;/em&gt; seems to fit that &amp;lsquo;cheap and best&amp;rsquo;  bucket if sourced second hand. They seem to be selling for about 70 USD.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switched off my phone from airplane mode first thing this morning to check on the &amp;lsquo;Shutdown&amp;rsquo; status and as expected congress did fail to secure those 60 votes. Also received a couple emails mentioning my position was &lt;em&gt;non-excepted&lt;/em&gt; and hence I was effectively furloughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Received another email around 2200 stating my position is now considered &lt;em&gt;excepted&lt;/em&gt; and I need to report back to work the next working day. Alrighty, we&amp;rsquo;re back in business. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/01/furloughed/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/uses&#34;&gt;uses&lt;/a&gt; page on my portal. Whoa. Adds up to almost 2500 USD. Agreed, that&amp;rsquo;s over several years but still! And, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t even include &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the gadgets I physically have! Wonder what a typical person spends on gadgets over a decade? How much do you spend? &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/12/uses/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL Syncthing has an option to &amp;lsquo;ignore delete&amp;rsquo; in its advanced settings. Suepr neat! This simplifies posting images from the phone and lets me &amp;lsquo;declutter&amp;rsquo; the phone super fast. Likey, likey! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/21/ignore-delete/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
