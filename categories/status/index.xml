      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think I almost figured out how to have different feeds for tags and categories in Hugo! Modified the feed so the title is replaced with the publish date instead so feed readers display the content properly instead of just the title and a link to the post. Might still have a few kinks but I think we&amp;rsquo;re slowly getting there&amp;hellip;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was supposed to be a &amp;lsquo;Bridged&amp;rsquo; holiday. In this part of the world, the president apparently declares certain days to be holidays if they happen to fall adjacent to a previously declared public holiday and the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tomorrow being Cameroon day, rumor was that today would be one of those bridged holidays. Sadly it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Locally employed staff were definitely not happy. The Ambo did declare a 59 minute early release. Got the message while we were amidst a small project and not quite at a good stopping point. So we chugged along and head home when we were done. Will take it in spirit though. Merci Beaucoup! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/19/unbridged/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back from a work trip in Malabo. Got there last Thursday and worked through the weekend. We completed a minor site upgrade and completed almost all of the planned work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to explore any of the island since we were mostly shuttling back and forth from work. From what little I did get to see though, this place is beautiful. Between China&amp;rsquo;s belt and road initiative and the island&amp;rsquo;s oil money from the 90s, Infrastructure looked to be quite top notch. The airport terminal is quite spiffy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food was mediocre at best. The Magno hotel has a decent restaurant. Next time I&amp;rsquo;m here I should probably come over the weekend to explore the cafe&amp;rsquo;s and the boardwalk a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ~230 Ft towering Ceiba tree in the embassy compound is a terrific sight. Apparently this tree is quite prevalent all across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet in the hotel was barely functional - for call&amp;rsquo;s atleast. Looks like some port-blocking was definitely at play. Not having those daily calls back home maybe also made the trip feel a bit longer that it actually was? Need to go better prepared next time!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/pinocchio.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

S wanted me to read Pinocchio out to her this afternoon. Later this night, right after she brushed her teeth, she innocently asked me if &amp;lsquo;wishing stars&amp;rsquo; were true. I of course, confirmed they did exist and that she had to patiently wait for the magic to come through. Now girl, not everything you read in books is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long she&amp;rsquo;ll actually believe these things but I do hope to keep this awesome concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/12/26/magic/&#34;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; alive in her as much as I can.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/04/pinocchio/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a good run with wireguard over the last four years, I switched over the devices on my home network to Tailscale today to lean-in on its mesh abilities. Technically I could have modified my wireguard setup to be a mesh network. But I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to tweak each configuration file!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/lifemap&#34;&gt;Lifemap&lt;/a&gt; page a bit more and added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote&#34;&gt;Daily Note&lt;/a&gt; page for friction-less notes. Love how this is all coming together. Also in anticipation of the upcoming move, switched comment notifications to the public URL. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/23/qol-upgrades/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got barely two weeks left here in CDMX! As with any move, we&amp;rsquo;ve been trimming our holdings down. Still amazed that I can fit almost all of my vital belongings into two 50 lbs suitcases. As a family our holdings weighed about 3000 lbs in total when we moved to Mexico city. Pretty sure we should be in that ball-park for this move too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made the tough call NOT to hike Orizaba the coming weekend. I think I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the mind space to plan it all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to let go of the 3D Printer I bought from a colleague last year. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time to tinker with it and it just sank in, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a tough time getting the supplies shipped over to Yaounde. Some indulgences - invested or not - are probably just worth letting go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweaked my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/05/implementing-static-comments/&#34;&gt;comments code&lt;/a&gt; to send notifications to my NTFY channel when this site receives spam - just for kicks. And boy, it does seem to work. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/12/time/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We borrowed &lt;a href=&#34;http://0.0.0.0:8123/2017/03/25/millebornes/&#34;&gt;Millebornes&lt;/a&gt; from the Hancocks couple days ago since S has totally gotten into it now. The one we owned mysteriously went missing when we PCSâ€™d to CDMX last year. Time to order a few more boxes of this and Monopoly Deal!&lt;/p&gt;
