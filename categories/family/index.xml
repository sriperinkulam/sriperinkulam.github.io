      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last several days have been extremely trying on the family. Mummyjaan had a cardiac arrest on 27 June. She woke up that morning complaining of uneasiness and moving pain across her chest and back. We initially thought it was gas and I made my way to work, just as usual. S sent me an email at around 0800 mentioning the pain wasn&amp;rsquo;t subsiding and that we&amp;rsquo;d have to take her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health unit suggested we take her to the Central Hospital in Yaounde. Around 0815 she began sweating profusely and the pain only seemed to increase. Motorpool was called and we made it to the hospital in about 30 minutes. Took us about an hour to speak to the cardiologist and she confirmed it was an MI event. The hospital didn&amp;rsquo;t have a Cath lab so Thrombolysis was the next step to stabilise her. As luck would have it, the hospital did not have the block-buster drug needed to do the Thrombolysis. They mentioned the military hospital had it and the doctor was willing to come with us to get the drug. M went with the doctor since the doctor only spoke French, while we waited at the hospital. Once there,  M texted that she didn&amp;rsquo;t have the cash needed. 160k FCFA. Easy day. The hospital was generous enough to release the drug without initial payment. I head to the Military hospital to pay for the drug and the doctors in the Central Hospital started the treatment. Once I find the two nurses at the Military hospital, they walk me to the chief doctors&amp;rsquo; room that&amp;rsquo;s hidden all the way in one of the nooks of the hospital. Only there I realise, they wanted 1.6 Million FCFA and not 160k FCFA. That&amp;rsquo;s about 3000 USD and they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take credit card or USD either. I tell them I&amp;rsquo;ll have to get back with the funds and make my way out of the hospital. We barely had 500 USD equivalent FCFA in hand. The bank in the embassy was closed given it was a Friday. We reached out to as many people as we could and finally pooled enough money to cover the costs. M and I head back to the hospital handing over the wads of cash and hoping they stick to the deal. Probably the biggest sigh of relief I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a while walking away with that receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/CentralHospitalYND.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the hospital, the doctors mentioned the process was successful and she was recovering well. Not quite sure exactly when, but we glean from them that she did go into a cardiac shock after the drugs administration. Dobutamin was administered to support the heart. As we explore our next steps we realise we barely have any options left here in Cameroon. Family docs confirmed getting an Angio is the next course of action. There&amp;rsquo;s no cath lab nearby and we were nowhere confident about the post-op healthcare here. Meanwhile, over the weekend we have abysmally poor support or information from the nurses and doctors. They&amp;rsquo;re barely divulging any information and the ICU doctor apparently made the rounds but never spoke to us. We pull all possible strings we can. Jimmy Francis is able to get the President&amp;rsquo;s doctor visit the hospital and the embassy put some more pressure on the hospital to atleast give us as much information as they could. Things slowly improved a bit after this but we&amp;rsquo;re barely satisfied. The doctors seem to know their trade but there&amp;rsquo;s just so little infrastructure support. Their extremely slow pace of action and poor communication was beyond concerning. We decide to Medevac her as soon as we could mobilize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours of debating the pros and cons of medevacing her to Nairobi, Joberg, Morroco, Dubai and Chennai; we decided to get her to Dubai. It was monday evening already. The air ambulance needed 100% funds upfront and they also needed a confirmation letter from the receiving hospital that they would accept the patient. The Kuletha&amp;rsquo;s were exceptionally helpful in getting the legwork done for the Air-ambulance and the hospital admission in Dubai. Finally around 0200 on 01st July, we were able to get her medevac&amp;rsquo;d out of YaoundÃ©. Miss V and I head in the air ambulance with mummyjaan.  We make a technical stop in Nairobi and finally make it to Dubai that evening. Beyond glad, she handled the takeoffs and landings well. Once in Dubai, at Fakeeh University Hospital the moment we met and spoke to Dr. Sakib, I was convinced we were in safe hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days, under excellent observation and medical care, she recovered pretty well. On Friday, during the Angio, the doctors gave her a stent and reported the only artery that was blocked was the one that was serving the heart. We&amp;rsquo;d probably be looking at locomotive or cognitive impairment had it been somewhere else! So unluckily lucky! What a coincidence that she got her stent done on M&amp;rsquo;s birthday in the city that M was born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that bullet thwarted, I think we&amp;rsquo;d be remiss if we didn&amp;rsquo;t take some actionable steps. Need to get those baseline health checks in place. We&amp;rsquo;re going to stall anybody from visiting us until they have a Medevac insurance sorted out. I need to plan for more liquidity in my emergency funds given how cash-dependent this country is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has probably been the most stressful thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me in a while. Even when Amma was sick, I think I knew what to expect. We were sort of in a Catch22 situation here. The medical facilities weren&amp;rsquo;t quite kitted to handle cardiac issues and we had to stabilise her before we could even consider medevacing her for further care. Thankfully we had doctors in the family who were able to provide remote assistance and guided us with questions to ask. But for those vital family and friend connections, this could have ended up way differently&amp;hellip;So many things to be grateful for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S celebrated her 6th today.  Unicorn themed - of course - and had her first and probably last ever PiÃ±ata. But for a mega meltdown initially she did great all through the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we signed up for a Diwali party organized by the Indian Association in Mexico. Primarily on a whim and maybe for the food? The event was last evening and boy, it was a terrible disappointment! It started late as expected. And obnoxiously loud for no reason. Not quite sure if it was the acoustics at the venue or just the MC shouting into the mic.  Maybe both? I love some good rock and metal. I love some good loud music. But I guess not all loud is the same. Also, this day and age, who even does a looping slideshow of pictures of people organizing the event? Dinner was supposed to be served by 1900. Servers said they had orders to serve only at 2030. Maybe the organizers wanted the food to be served only after the main event? When we rechecked at 2030, they said it was pushed to 2130. Had enough of it and walked out.  People were still on the dance floor and there was a good turn out. I guess this kinda boisterous social mayhem is just not my jam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head out to a Japanese (?) restaurant in Polanco since Nimi&amp;rsquo;s, Mei Mei and Manaw were all closed for service. Sushi was &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;. S did great all through the evening though despite the loud music and the crowd. That &amp;lsquo;Sticker by number&amp;rsquo; book that she received as a gift from Maddy kept her fully occupied!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning here and S is off for school. She was mildly upset that I get to stay at home while she needs to go to school. Fair world logic, I guess. We drop her and get to spend a couple hours together watching &lt;em&gt;Spenser Confidential&lt;/em&gt;. Enjoyed it all the more because we recognized quite a few locations where the movie was shot. M&amp;rsquo;s got some brunch out with the ladies in a bit and then a couple more hours before I need to pick up S. Maybe I should tweak that 3D printer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being overseas and not having access to firecrackers, this festival is just not what it used to be. I wish I could go back to those days when we would try and wake up before Kitta mama would burst his 1000 wala before the break of dawn. Days when you yearn to wear those new set of clothes - The only time of the year when you get new clothes and not hand-me-downs. Days when you make a TON of sweets and savories to share with family and friends. Days when you would hop into people&amp;rsquo;s houses uninvited to see what special delicacy they&amp;rsquo;ve made. Days when every single house is lit up and the smoke of firecrackers permeate everything. Such good memories&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diwali this year was super low key. We did light up some &lt;em&gt;Diyas&lt;/em&gt; and M had ordered some savory snacks from one of her local contacts. A few calls to family and I think we called it a day. Times when you miss being amongst family and friends. Happy Halloween and Diwali - I guess?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With quite a few developments on the personal front, the last few months has kept me quite &amp;lsquo;busy&amp;rsquo;. Despite Covid, I did a bunch of travel which is always nice! Last August, Appa kinda lost his patience and wanted to make a trip to India. We figured September was the most optimal time and I flew over to MD to accompany him back. With just a day off work, I was able to finagle a whirlwind weekend trip to the US and back. M and S head over to the states in October to be a bit of a help in MD while I looked after two grand old men here in India. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I&amp;rsquo;ve done this and but for a few rough days, I loved spending time helping them accomplish what they wanted to over the course of three months. Appa was able to get most of his &amp;lsquo;admin&amp;rsquo; stuff done and more importantly got to spend time with his younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December I made a quick trip to Delhi to meet folks at work. Was good catching up after all of these months of telework! Mid December and just before the Omicron wave hit the Asian region, we were asked to report into work on premises. Obviously made sense to take Appa back to MD since we didn&amp;rsquo;t want him to be living alone - more so when we started seeing the Omicron effect in the US, Israel and UK. I accompanied him back on the 31st and used this opportunity to also take some time off to spend with M &amp;amp; S! It was a much needed break and we did get to do a bunch of stuff in the short time that I was there: Got the Moderna booster - In tandem with Jet-lag, the next day fatigue was a killer, Went on a nice date with M to a Thai restaurant - but for the jasmine spray hand sanitizer..UGH!, Took S our for &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/01/trolley-trail/&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/05/patapsco-thru-trail/&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/06/oregon-ridge-park/&#34;&gt;hikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/05/january-6-2022-0609/&#34;&gt;Built a scooter&lt;/a&gt; for S, Migrated my servers over to MD, packed my belongings in all of 65lbs and moved to Delhi. The return leg was quite happening with American transferring my booking to BA and transitingÂ  me via Heathrow. Called for a lot of last minute Covid digital paperwork. Thank goodness to smartphones and free WiFi access in Airports!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I&amp;rsquo;m super excited to be in Delhi! Still too many variables at play and oddly that seems to be the constant in our lives. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to explore this fascinating city and then head further up north during the weekends. Omicron is going to hugely shape the next few months and I&amp;rsquo;m going to make best use of the wrenches it&amp;rsquo;s gonna throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy (Belated) New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

The return leg was quite happening with American transferring my booking to BA and transitingÂ  me via Heathrow. Called for a lot of last minute Covid digital paperwork. Thank goodness to smartphones and free WiFi access in Airports!</p>
<p>For now I&rsquo;m super excited to be in Delhi! Still too many variables at play and oddly that seems to be the constant in our lives. Can&rsquo;t wait to explore this fascinating city and then head further up north during the weekends. Omicron is going to hugely shape the next few months and I&rsquo;m going to make best use of the wrenches it&rsquo;s gonna throw.</p>
<p>Happy (Belated) New Year!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diwali it is and I&amp;rsquo;m so lucky to be at AJ this year. Though most of the family is not here, I did want to get those positive light vibes in the house. Appa and I got the diyas out and lit them up like we&amp;rsquo;ve usually done during the years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Imagepipe_4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brought back so many fond memories of celebrating the festival when we were kids. Starting right at 04:00 with &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/?s=kitta&#34;&gt;Kitta Mama&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 1000 Walla, Appa and Amma&amp;rsquo;s push to get us that pre-dawn morning shower, the house bustling with activity as sweets and savories are consumed quicker than they&amp;rsquo;re made, neighbors drifting in and out exchanging wishes and gifts, kids bragging on the volume of firecracker purchase, bursting crackers near oblivious strangers in the colony, smoke of various hues of green and orange bellowing from that â€˜snakeâ€™ firecracker, appa bursting the â€˜lakshmi bombâ€™ using a pair of tongs, and amma -oh looking so beautiful- cautiously lighting the â€˜sparklerâ€™ while keeping an eye on all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one festival really close to my heart since it reminds me so much of the good times we had with Amma. I so wish she were around with us today and it&amp;rsquo;s just not fair that she left us so early. It&amp;rsquo;s been 21 years and it feels just yesterday we were on that &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2018/11/20/shasta/&#34;&gt;hospital terrace watching fireworks&lt;/a&gt; during her last Diwali. But then to think of it, nothing really is the same as before. The celebration across the colony is heavily dampened. Those old neighbors have moved out. Folks now use digital lights if at all they do light up their houses. Barely anyone is actually bursting fire crackers. In essence, it feels like the spirit of celebration is quite diluted for whatever reason. Time flies and I&amp;rsquo;m glad some memories remain etched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Diwali to you and your loved ones. There&amp;rsquo;s so much power in those tiny flickering flames.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since March 2020, I&amp;rsquo;ve had this internal debate of getting the Covid Vaccine mostly underlined by the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3d3bb2ac73.65468826&#34;&gt;science behind mRNA&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating andÂ so is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3c8962f2a2.96282489&#34;&gt;engineering of the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every strand of mRNA is made up of four molecular building blocks called nucleosides. But in its altered, synthetic form, one of those building blocks, like a misaligned wheel on a car, was throwing everything off by signaling the immune system. So KarikÃ³ and Weissman simply subbed it out for a slightly tweaked version, creating a hybrid mRNA that could sneak its way into cells without alerting the bodyâ€™s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statnews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We unfortunately &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html%5D&#34;&gt;have not had a spectacular history&lt;/a&gt; with vaccines. With humans involved and the ensuing politics, money and power-plays; vaccines are built for the average human being. Then with anything manufactured and delivered at scale, we&amp;rsquo;re prone to Logistics and Supply chain Management issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covid19 vaccines are not a once and done deal. The effects &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/607a14edb61f01.57427531&#34;&gt;last apparently at most a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did cave in and got the first â€˜jab&amp;rsquo; of the Moderna vaccine today at the Consulate. As with all vaccines and medical interventions, this was not quite an easy decision. The decision was probably 40% gut, 40% trusting the mechanics of the mRNA vaccine and 20% of &amp;lsquo;Why am I even considering it&amp;rsquo;. The drivers for the gut-feeling likely being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the vaccine would possibly break the link in transmitting the virus to an immune-compromised person. We live with our in-laws and that&amp;rsquo;s the least I can do for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I consider myself to be a fairly young and healthy person and absolutely do not mind wearing masks and exercising social distancing. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve shamefully caught myself pulling down the mask during brief interactions with people. Despite best efforts, the masking system alone is not fool-proof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to be outdoors to stay healthy and be sane. Travel and Freedom are my primary &amp;lsquo;movers&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From an extremely exaggerated perspective, I see C19 as the Smallpox / Polio of this century.Â Few folks in the family are still reeling with the brutal after-effects of these diseases. I think I can take the risk of the possible side-effects for the marginal leg-up the vaccine might give my immune system in case I contract the virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks in the family are leaning towards getting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/607a1f2977e8c3.93743514&#34;&gt;Covaxin&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. India is having it&amp;rsquo;s worst wave so far and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping we swing back downwards as sharply as we rose.&lt;/p&gt;
