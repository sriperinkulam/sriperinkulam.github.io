      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bailing out to the new media - Will we though? In some form or fashion those that are leaving are probably just finding  a different medium where they&amp;rsquo;re able to connect better? I actually think there are more people blogging now than before. Just in different dispersed mediums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually if we do, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be just the ebbs and flows of a social framework? People come in, people leave. You make a connection here and a connection there and hope to linger in that ether of those network connections that&amp;rsquo;s always in a flux. Also isn&amp;rsquo;t blogging a sort of &amp;rsquo;new media&amp;rsquo; when compared to postcards or aerogram? When was the last time you sent or received one?&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/06/06/letting-go/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://withknown.com/&#34;&gt;WithKnown&lt;/a&gt; for about a minute several years ago. Loved the interface and software but it never really stood the test of time. Yesterday, while searching for older posts related to Uganda, I realized, I never quite moved those posts over. Spent about an hour yesterday and migrated those over to this portal. While at it, I also migrated my old twitter posts over. And with that I think all content is now present on this portal. Since the feed settings are limited to 10 most recent posts, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t spam the RSS feeds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S wanted me to read Pinocchio out to her this afternoon. Later this night, right after she brushed her teeth, she innocently asked me if &amp;lsquo;wishing stars&amp;rsquo; were true. I of course, confirmed they did exist and that she had to patiently wait for the magic to come through. Now girl, not everything you read in books is true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long she&amp;rsquo;ll actually believe these things but I do hope to keep this awesome concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/12/26/magic/&#34;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; alive in her as much as I can.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/04/pinocchio/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a good run with wireguard over the last four years, I switched over the devices on my home network to Tailscale today to lean-in on its mesh abilities. Technically I could have modified my wireguard setup to be a mesh network. But I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to tweak each configuration file!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wanderer.to/&#34;&gt;Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; looks super neat. I have a basic implementation of GPX mapping on my site which could use some tinkering. Thanks for the recommendation!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/lifemap&#34;&gt;Lifemap&lt;/a&gt; page a bit more and added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote&#34;&gt;Daily Note&lt;/a&gt; page for friction-less notes. Love how this is all coming together. Also in anticipation of the upcoming move, switched comment notifications to the public URL. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/23/qol-upgrades/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bit the bullet and setup a rudimentary comment system for this site. For the last few months, I relied on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isso-comments/isso/&#34;&gt;ISSO&lt;/a&gt;, but it kinda felt a bit too heavy. Finally scratched the itch and switched over to a basic form and some javascript to push comments over to my self-hosted ntfy server. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve left the moderation to manual mode - I have to copy over the comments manually from NTFY to a comments.json file. A GO script that usually publishes this site also builds the comments for each of the posts as needed  based on the posts&amp;rsquo; permalink. Pretty friction-less and nifty! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/05/implementing-static-comments/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took me a bit but I finally got a decent handle on displaying the gpx summary on the gpx map. Still a bunch of tweaks to make this look better but super happy with how this is shaping. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/24/mapping-gpx/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
