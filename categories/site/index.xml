      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a fucking miserable day today&amp;rsquo;s been. Came home this evening to the Main breaker panel being down again. Called FAC. While we were figuring out the issue with the power, we heard OP was electrocuted while playing in his yard and didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. Such a freaking tragic loss. How do you even come to terms with shit like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, little one. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember your glowing eyes and sheepish grin as you &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34;&gt;won me in your empire&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you delicately handling your food when you came over to our place for dinner. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you sitting by the side of the emb pool slowly contemplating if you wanted to get in or not. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you running all over your yard behind those bunnies. And I so so wish I got to know you more while you were around&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is so fucking fickle. Hug your dear ones&amp;rsquo; more than ever before.&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2026/01/15/op/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

Built a tiny posting interface to cross-post content from this site to elsewhere on-demand if needed. Since I exclude my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote&#34;&gt;daynotes&lt;/a&gt; in my main rss feed, this helps reduce the friction a bit if I want to push out certain &lt;em&gt;sections&lt;/em&gt; of a daynote on a whim. Still crude and janky but seems to do the job! #indieweb &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/12/16/posse/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those four words - &amp;lsquo;But it is mine&amp;rsquo;; Definitely makes it all worth it. I have a similar setup wherein I use a Hetzner VPS just to proxy in all traffic to my selfhosted stuff. Initially had wireguard running across my devices. Switched to tailscale for a bit more ease of management. Maybe every six months or so something breaks, but it is all manageable. Gets fixed if I really want to, else it stays by the wayside until it really needs to come back up. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/12/11/digital-house/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t figured where/when we want to retire yet, but sadly the U.S. seems to be a bleaker option with every passing day. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any country has really figured out their healthcare system well and those that had a decent stab at it seem to be hell bent on breaking it. For now, thankfully our Foreign service benefit plan does an okay job and we&amp;rsquo;re at an okay premium-benefit ratio. Only a question of time before that buckles though. As a former actuary, I do subscribe to the concept of having good insurance. However, the good ones are so few and stretched so thin. I keep telling my wife if we want to stay in the U.S. I should get back to teaching - Not just because I love it, but because it might also keep our premiums low in retirement. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/12/03/insurance/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the phone, I use Signal&amp;rsquo;s note-to-self to record on-the-go thoughts or to  quickly bookmark stuff. Later when on the laptop, I migrate these to my Trilium notes. After years of dabbling between multiple &amp;rsquo;notes&amp;rsquo; applications, this has stuck. Using the default messaging app as my notes &amp;lsquo;filter&amp;rsquo; definitely streamlined the process.

&lt;p&gt;Why does it feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing the same story multiple times over the last three days? Because, maybe I actually did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote something to that effect earlier today to one of the teams I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to resolve an ongoing issue with. They are a good bunch of folks. But there seems to be a disconnect somewhere that&amp;rsquo;s causing needless delays in what I&amp;rsquo;d like to get done. I feel issues fail to get resolved mostly because of lack of proper communication during their shift handovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes after I sent that note, somewhere it also hit me real hard. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really have sent that note? It does not benefit anybody but just my restless self. Adds nothing positive to the situation and if anything effectively brings the relationship a few steps backwards. Super frustrating when you see both sides of the coin and still need to get shit done&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/11/14/handover/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because power, greed and corruption blindsided us and we got complacent with short term profits? Beyond ridiculous that we&amp;rsquo;ve been running on layered CR band-aids almost every year making it more of a norm than an exception. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/11/07/shutdown/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the primary draw in Webmentions for me is the &amp;lsquo;context&amp;rsquo; it provides. Several years down the lane when your &amp;lsquo;rewind&amp;rsquo; brings up a post, the value that provides is quite amplified when you are able to see what/when it was written for. Totally appreciate the &amp;rsquo;nudge&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;connection&amp;rsquo; factor too. After all, the inter-web exists because of people and connections we bring in. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/27/webmentions/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
