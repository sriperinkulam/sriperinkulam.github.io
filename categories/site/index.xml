      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the primary draw in Webmentions for me is the &amp;lsquo;context&amp;rsquo; it provides. Several years down the lane when your &amp;lsquo;rewind&amp;rsquo; brings up a post, the value that provides is quite amplified when you are able to see what/when it was written for. Totally appreciate the &amp;rsquo;nudge&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;connection&amp;rsquo; factor too. After all, the inter-web exists because of people and connections we bring in. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/27/webmentions/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic, @hund@fosstodon.org ! Thanks for the nudge! I did try Gadgetbridge a few years ago. They didn&amp;rsquo;t quite support Garmin then. Gave it a spin just now and looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way! So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been exporting my garmin to my site but nothing like a full fledged app with all the bells and whistles. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/gadget-bridge/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immich is pretty neat! It does hog /need a decent machine to run though. I briefly dabbled  installing it on an RPi3 a year ago and figured the juice wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the squeeze for what I was looking at. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty content with having all my media on a Nextcloud server where rest of my files reside. This seven year old repurposed laptop on which NC runs In tandem with Tailscale and a digital frame, serves most of my needs for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also love that subtle clink you have going on in the comment form! Pretty crafty! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/immich/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week in Malabo, I discovered that none of my self-hosted services were working. Initially, I thought it was due to my home internet connection. However, upon returning last night, I realized that wasnâ€™t the case at all. My tiny reverse proxy, Caddy, had encountered an issue during an automated security upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve adopted a hands-off approach to self-hosting, setting up auto-updates for all my services. I only intervene when something breaks. Today, I decided to give my setup a little TLC, upgrading my passthrough VPS and Odroid XU4 to Bookworm. Remarkably, the process took less than 30 minutes! Thanks to Docker and Tailscale, everything connects seamlessly and just works. Love it! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/caddy-not-caddying/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between M&amp;amp;S taking ill earlier this week and the shutdown/furlough drama on Wednesday, last week whizzed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined the Poth&amp;rsquo;s for a game night on Friday. S and the kids watched &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; while we played a bunch of games. Building your empire, Skyjoy, Really bad art, and that one real interesting game which we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to play&amp;hellip;2100 and had to get S to bed to be ready for the Swim meet next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnected with D. Konduru after almost 6 years. Time files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com//2021/10/07/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt; popped in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; today. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember posting about this but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I saved it in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&amp;rsquo;s down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/&#34;&gt;almost 10 year old&lt;/a&gt; hard drive before it goes kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicale.org/v3.html&#34;&gt;Radicale&lt;/a&gt; instance in my homeserver and configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davx5.com/&#34;&gt;DAVx5&lt;/a&gt; on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And just like that three-quarters of 2025 is in the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon is gearing for its Presidential elections. They go to polls on October 12th and it&amp;rsquo;s almost given that Paul Biya, who&amp;rsquo;s been in power since 1982, will be elected as the next president. He&amp;rsquo;s rocking it at 92 years. Of the 30 million populace only about 8 million are eligible to vote (20 years and older). Historically, these elections have been mired with civil unrest&amp;rsquo;s and protests. The next few weeks will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tomorrow night, if the Congress fails to  reach an agreement, we&amp;rsquo;re potentially looking at a shutdown. Beyond ridiculous that we seem to be at this juncture so frequently and living on continuing resolutions. This time around possibility of furloughs and RIFs [Reduction in Force] are highly likely. And then there&amp;rsquo;s also the drama that comes with it&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M most likely received her LNA invite. Yay! Looks like a training in December is a serious possibility. But again it&amp;rsquo;s never a given until she gets there and completes it. Adds a wrench to our planned December R&amp;amp;R and then a bigger wrench to how we handle bidding. 2026 is going to be beyond interesting. Choices, options, decisions and happy problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/29/themocracy/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went out to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://apeactionafrica.org/mefou-primate-sanctuary&#34;&gt;Mefou Primate Santuary&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Just about 45 minutes from the city, this was an easy drive with pretty decent roads. Got to see a few chimps, spot monkeys and Gorillas. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome that they&amp;rsquo;re able to provide a terrific ecosystem for these primates to recover.  For as little as 35 GBP you could &lt;a href=&#34;https://apeactionafrica.org/sponsor-an-ape&#34;&gt;sponsor an ape&lt;/a&gt;!
