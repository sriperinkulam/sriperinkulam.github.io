      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/map&#34;&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; page to reflect posts that have a set location. Currently this is a super vanilla layout and I think I should cluster these by region. I do like how it&amp;rsquo;s turned out though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at it, I realised I missed downloading pictures from my old Flickr account to Nextcloud. Brought those in and nuked the Flickr account. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/03/maps/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://withknown.com/&#34;&gt;WithKnown&lt;/a&gt; for about a minute several years ago. Loved the interface and software but it never really stood the test of time. Yesterday, while searching for older posts related to Uganda, I realized, I never quite moved those posts over. Spent about an hour yesterday and migrated those over to this portal. While at it, I also migrated my old twitter posts over. And with that I think all content is now present on this portal. Since the feed settings are limited to 10 most recent posts, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t spam the RSS feeds.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a good run with wireguard over the last four years, I switched over the devices on my home network to Tailscale today to lean-in on its mesh abilities. Technically I could have modified my wireguard setup to be a mesh network. But I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to tweak each configuration file!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/lifemap&#34;&gt;Lifemap&lt;/a&gt; page a bit more and added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote&#34;&gt;Daily Note&lt;/a&gt; page for friction-less notes. Love how this is all coming together. Also in anticipation of the upcoming move, switched comment notifications to the public URL. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/23/qol-upgrades/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bit the bullet and setup a rudimentary comment system for this site. For the last few months, I relied on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isso-comments/isso/&#34;&gt;ISSO&lt;/a&gt;, but it kinda felt a bit too heavy. Finally scratched the itch and switched over to a basic form and some javascript to push comments over to my self-hosted ntfy server. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve left the moderation to manual mode - I have to copy over the comments manually from NTFY to a comments.json file. A GO script that usually publishes this site also builds the comments for each of the posts as needed  based on the posts&amp;rsquo; permalink. Pretty friction-less and nifty! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/05/implementing-static-comments/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took me a bit but I finally got a decent handle on displaying the gpx summary on the gpx map. Still a bunch of tweaks to make this look better but super happy with how this is shaping. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/24/mapping-gpx/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; page to nudge me to read my older posts. Interesting to see how my thought processes and writing has shifted over the years. This might also serve as a tool to fix any issues that might have crept in when I migrated over to Hugo. While at it, I also tweaked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/archives&#34;&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt; page a bit to make it less dense.&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/12/rewind/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my free time over the last few days has been spent trying to implement the comments section on this site. Something that would have been super straightforward on a regular CMS is not quite so for a static site. Initially I tinkered with the idea of side-loading the comments feature over to the fediverse. It worked okay but it did feel quite choppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around a bit, I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://isso-comments.de/&#34;&gt;ISSO&lt;/a&gt; a chance. It seemed to have all the features I was looking for and was reasonably easy to setup. As with most things tech though, I had quite some difficulty tweaking it to work the way I wanted it to. Taking a break and getting back to it after a few days, did get me to approach this from a different perspective and I think it&amp;rsquo;s super close to where I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On certain things, I am perfectly okay leaving things half baked and cutting my losses. On most things though, I do like seeing things to closure. There&amp;rsquo;s so much thrill in figuring out why something is not working the way it is supposed to. Most often it&amp;rsquo;s because of something ridiculously silly or because of minor oversights. Trials and tribulations of the last mile closures, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, this site has a basic commenting system and that gives me enough momentum to pursue other things to tweak. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/09/last-mile-closures/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
