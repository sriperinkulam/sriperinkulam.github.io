      <description>&lt;p&gt;/s This turned out to be simpler than I thought. All I had to do was add all the libraries to the overdriive account on the desktop. And then login to that overdrive account on the Kobo. By design, only one card shows on the Kobo. To borrow books from a library not shown on the Kobo, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to fetch that on a separate device. So simple!  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/10/clara/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is such a neat idea. Love a good purposeful e-ink display! Adding his &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WebOrigami/japan-hike-ebook&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; to my read-list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Infyblogs and the internal BB were a great place to hang out! Over the last couple decades, haven&amp;rsquo;t quiteÂ  found a thriving network that is anywhere similar to those channels. Thinking of it, my foray into Linux was solely due to InfyLUG! Wonder if they still have those running!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Also I guess to subconsciously coax more people to do it? This is a fascinating concept and I wish something that was replicated widely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomorrow.me/&#34;&gt;Tomorrow app&lt;/a&gt; to set one up for my family a few years ago. Also last year, I setup an &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/08/06/building-the-end-plan/&#34;&gt;End Plan Document&lt;/a&gt; to help them pick the loose ends. Honestly, itâ€™s helped me document things better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so glad I moved out of the Apple ecosystem a few years back. Was good while I was using it and now that I&amp;rsquo;m off, I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow or have the urge to upgrade to the next in-thing. It is liberating and I guess - to each his own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely love such &amp;lsquo;meandering&amp;rsquo; posts! You never know what you&amp;rsquo;re going to be reading in the next para and the heading can only do justice to a specific section.&lt;/p&gt;
