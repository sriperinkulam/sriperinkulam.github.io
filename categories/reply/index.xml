      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bailing out to the new media - Will we though? In some form or fashion those that are leaving are probably just finding  a different medium where they&amp;rsquo;re able to connect better? I actually think there are more people blogging now than before. Just in different dispersed mediums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually if we do, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be just the ebbs and flows of a social framework? People come in, people leave. You make a connection here and a connection there and hope to linger in that ether of those network connections that&amp;rsquo;s always in a flux. Also isn&amp;rsquo;t blogging a sort of &amp;rsquo;new media&amp;rsquo; when compared to postcards or aerogram? When was the last time you sent or received one?&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/06/06/letting-go/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;/s This turned out to be simpler than I thought. All I had to do was add all the libraries to the overdriive account on the desktop. And then login to that overdrive account on the Kobo. By design, only one card shows on the Kobo. To borrow books from a library not shown on the Kobo, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to fetch that on a separate device. So simple!  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/10/clara/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is such a neat idea. Love a good purposeful e-ink display! Adding his &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WebOrigami/japan-hike-ebook&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; to my read-list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Infyblogs and the internal BB were a great place to hang out! Over the last couple decades, haven&amp;rsquo;t quite  found a thriving network that is anywhere similar to those channels. Thinking of it, my foray into Linux was solely due to InfyLUG! Wonder if they still have those running!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Also I guess to subconsciously coax more people to do it? This is a fascinating concept and I wish something that was replicated widely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomorrow.me/&#34;&gt;Tomorrow app&lt;/a&gt; to set one up for my family a few years ago. Also last year, I setup an &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/08/06/building-the-end-plan/&#34;&gt;End Plan Document&lt;/a&gt; to help them pick the loose ends. Honestly, it’s helped me document things better.&lt;/p&gt;
