Definitely not at that moment though. Somewhere near Cuernavaca, The Grand Vitara had a brake fade 1 this morning on our way to Las Estacas. The brakes would just not work and it felt like I had to pump it to get even a bit of traction. Got super close to hitting the car in front of us but thankfully, I found a small lane (ditch?) to veer off from the traffic and engine braked it to a stop. Super lucky none of us were hurt and we were able to veer away from traffic just in time. Also lucky that this happened just about 100m from a mechanic shop! What are the odds? Took them about three hours to do a thorough check on all four wheels and fix the oil reservoir tray - which they broke while jacking the car up. Oh boy, what a start to this years\u0026rsquo; Christmas!\nImmediately after we were able to get the vehicle to a stop, M asked if it was the floor mat that was the culprit. Nope - I\u0026rsquo;d removed them a few days after we bought this car. All thanks to another dreadful experience several years ago in the Grand Cherokee.\nIgnorance and oversight only make sense in hindsight. About fifteen minutes before this incident, I did notice the brakes feeling soft and remember thinking - that\u0026rsquo;s odd the brakes worked just fine so far. Also maybe I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice the smoke from the tires because we were driving through quasi dirt roads? All signs of the brakes giving in - had I known about brake fade then.

Between work travel, syncing our individual schedules and just getting around to actually booking the trip; we finally get around visiting this beautiful place this weekend in November.\nAs we get off the plane, we\u0026rsquo;re immediately hit by a waft of the Yucatán humidity, soon followed by thick droplets of rain. Strikes me just then that we\u0026rsquo;re also right in the midst of the hurricane season. A quick lookup on the weather forecast reveals Hurricane Sara would be swinging past us and into the Gulf of Mexico in a bit. I slap myself on my wrist for not doing any research beforehand but also shrug this minor oversight very quickly. How bad could it actually be? Maybe some showers here and there? We walk outside the Chetumal airport for about 500m and take a taxi from the main road to Bacalar. Oscar offers to take us there for 550 pesos. This was about 50 pesos shy of the amount the tour planner had quoted. M immediately accepts and we\u0026rsquo;re on our way. First impressions of this place immediately remind me of Trivandrum - lush green vistas with coconut trees strewn all around, narrow roads and barely any traffic. There\u0026rsquo;s construction for Tren Maya happening along the route but it barely impacts our drive. In about 50 minutes we reach the hotel and check-in.\nS immediately comments on the smell of wood as we enter our room. She\u0026rsquo;s ambivalent of the smell but seems to love the room setup. She goes around exploring the windows and shower. Once we get settled in, we head out to explore the property a bit. Hotel Carolina looks good with the woodsy feel and being right on the lagoon - but it definitely feels more commercial than I had imagined it to be. Yet another slap on the wrist. Note to self not to go by just pictures next time around. Maybe this trip planner thing is not quite working for us? This is the first time in all these years we\u0026rsquo;re using one - An embassy colleague\u0026rsquo;s wife runs a dive business and plans trips for folks across central America. We thought we\u0026rsquo;d give her a shot for this trip. Anyways, the stomach rumbles and we head over to Mango y Chile - a quaint vegan restaurant right by Fuerte de San Filipe about 30 minutes walk from the hotel. The burgers and smoothies here are super delicious and we finish it off with some paletas. M\u0026rsquo;s restaurant picks barely go wrong! Back to the room and we settle down for the night.\nAround 0730 we stir awake and quickly get ready for the day. Plan is to head over to the fort to meet out boat captain who\u0026rsquo;s supposed to take us for a two hour ride in the lagoon. M messages the tour operator to check if the plan is still on since it\u0026rsquo;s super gloomy and heavy outside. She confirms and we head over to the fort. Just as we get to the fort, the skies let loose and the Boat captain gives us news that the police have closed the port for the day. We\u0026rsquo;re obviously disappointed and decide to grab a quick bite closer to the hotel. I offer to carry S on my shoulders as we make our way back in the pouring rain. The roads are flooded and the rain isn\u0026rsquo;t showing any signs of letting go. Love this walk back and it\u0026rsquo;s been quite sometime that we\u0026rsquo;ve actually done this! Some good breakfast at Noru\u0026rsquo;s and we make our way back to the hotel. M suggests we should probably consider getting back to CDMX that afternoon. Unfortunately, there are no tickets available on the flight. With that decision made for us, we decide to head back out for lunch at Enamora. Food here\u0026rsquo;s okay. As we make our way back to the hotel, the weather clears up a bit. S wanted to head to the kids pool and we nudge her to try out the swing in the water. Sara\u0026rsquo;s effect lingers and the water is super choppy. We try getting the kayak out for a bit but aren\u0026rsquo;t quite successful. Back to the room and we spend some good time in the portico by the hammock. After we\u0026rsquo;re back from dinner at Noru\u0026rsquo;s, I nudge S to head back to the wooden pier by the lagoon. We spend some time here as the sun sets and S plays with the idea of getting the kayak out. She flips it over in an instant and wants me to get in the water instead. The water does seem way calmer and I hop in to explore the waters. This impromptu wade in was probably one of the highlight\u0026rsquo;s for the day. We head back to the room. S spends some more time on the hammock and quickly falls asleep. M and I tinker with the idea of taking the kayak out the next morning to explore the lagoon by ourselves. As I type this at 0326 on Monday, I\u0026rsquo;m actually super psyched about this plan. Hoping S is game doing this in a few hours!\nAnd she is! We quickly change over in the morning and take to the waters. The weather is just right - Dark clouds hanging above and rays of sunshine creeping down. The water is much calmer and we\u0026rsquo;re near Cenote Negro in no time. We wade in the waters for about an hour and steal a few more minutes by the swing. Around 1030 we finally checkout and head to the airport after a brief breakfast stop at Ajal.\nWhile we didn\u0026rsquo;t quite get to explore the whole lagoon, I\u0026rsquo;m so glad we ended up staying for the extra day. Overall S thoroughly enjoyed the water and just lazing in the hammock. Lesson learnt though that we are best at planning our own trips and can\u0026rsquo;t wait to head to Baja California later this December!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/11/18/bacalar/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"BacalarLagoon.jpg\" alt=\"Cenote Negro\"  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBacalar has been on our travel list for quite sometime now.

I’m almost sold on stopping and getting a hot cup of coffee. I’m bone wet and good cup of coffee won’t hurt? Decide against it for whatever reason and head towards Chapultapec.

I just can’t remember where I saw it the last time. Well…the rain’s flooded the roads and you can barely see anything. I run across the 200 or so meters of flooded road hoping not step in an open manhole. Can’t be that bad…\nAbout four miles in. I cross the road and head towards the Museo de Antropologia. Tlaloc is definitely showering his blessings today! My legs feel good. They’ve always felt strong. But for that niggling knee pain. Maybe I should get it checked out? I should run more frequently. Maybe I won’t have this luxury in Yaounde. Why does it take so much effort to workout? Need to work on that tiny belly showing up…and maybe some upper body strength too? Get that climbing membership? I’ve got only five months left. And then all this work travel. Should probably just focus on Ashtanga. I think I’m – so close – to making that into a habit.\nOh this city reminds me so much of Pune. The monsoon, the lush green parks, the people, the smells…. I’m so glad Pune happened. Some real great memories were made there. I’m sure it’s not all the same now. Someday I should go back and reach out to all the people I led on the trails. Maybe they are still hiking somewhere? Would they even remember me?

It\u0026rsquo;s been a rough couple days. Oddly enough I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel one ounce of pain during the alpine hike I did on Saturday.\nWe summited Nevado de Toluca on Saturday and this would be one of my best hikes so far. Just two hours from Mexico city, this hike has something for everybody. First off, just getting to the alpine lakes from the base, which takes about 20 minutes, opens out the playground. One can literally see the whole terrain and trails that surround the pristine alpine lakes. We decide to head clockwise and summit Pico del Fraile (15388\u0026rsquo;). The climb up is reasonably straighforward and its mostly choosing your path to get to the peak.\nOnce at the peak, instead of scrambling downhill to the lakes, we decide to complete the loop and summit all the other peaks in that circuit. For the next 4 hours we\u0026rsquo;re trapezing the peaks, scrambling up and down paths of our choosing. It\u0026rsquo;s windy but not unreasonably cold. A thunderstorm looms further on one of the peaks and as we make plans to find cover under the rocks a mild hail storm hits us. Thankfully, our helmets protect us and we make decent progress towards the other peaks.\nThe sound of conch shells and drums give us constant company - From high up here at 15000\u0026rsquo; we see a group of about 30 people performing some ritual near one of the alpine lakes. As we push for the final descent we somehow loose our trail. All we\u0026rsquo;re left with is super loose soil and huge stones at a 80° gradient. There\u0026rsquo;s barely any grip here and we\u0026rsquo;re at the mercy of luck as we make our way down. Finally at around 1500 we reach the base and wait for the transport truck to take us down to the actual base.\nThis hike was such a contrast to Izta.

The way down from the Cerro was super steep at an 82° gradient. So glad we decided not to climb up from here and note to self to bring a knee brace for these downhills next time I hike here in CDMX. The loose volcanic soil and incessant pebbles make for dicey path downhill. We finish the hike at around 1400 and relish some hot cakes at one of the shacks at the base.\nMore than anything, this hike was a major morale booster after last weeks Izta attempt.\n2024-04-14 09:43:52 - Pico de Águila et Cerro La Cruz del Marquez 🥾 Hiked 4.69 miles in 04:50:29 Pace : 61.94 min/mile.

As we reach Portillo 1 in about an hour I do notice I\u0026rsquo;m hurting a bit. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t this difficult last evening. A short break here and we head up to Portillo 2. Marco our guide checks on how we\u0026rsquo;re doing and I tell him - Today\u0026rsquo;s not my day. The headache from last night lingers and I feel a bit queasy. First sign of altitude sickness hitting me. I ask if we can slow down the pace and keep moving. At Portillo 3, I\u0026rsquo;m laboring and for a moment I think I saw M climbing down. That can\u0026rsquo;t quite be true because she never did come on this hike. I eat a couple nutri bars and suggest I stick right behind Marco as we climb the loose soil gradient towards Portillo 4. Around 15000\u0026rsquo; I start feeling a bit dizzy and take a call to turn around. The group agrees and I stay real close to Marco just focussing on his feet movements. It\u0026rsquo;s still pitch dark. On the way down, a group of hikers attempting the summit wish us a good hike and trudge along in the opposite direction. As the last person in the group crosses me, one look at her and I realise its M and I turn around and follow her. Only issue being - it\u0026rsquo;s not her. She never came on this hike. I snap back into reality when Adam checks in on me questioning why I\u0026rsquo;d turned around. And this is when I realise my altitude sickness is getting worse - quicker. I take a couple minutes to gather myself and we attempt to scale down the peak as quickly and safely as we can.\nAt Portillo 1, we get some well needed rest. The sky is free of any pollution and all we see is beautiful stars strewn all over the pitch black sky. Shooting stars and satellites galore! I wish I had a good camera to capture this all. But then that would still do no justice to the magnificent show the universe was putting up this morning.\nThough we didn\u0026rsquo;t quite summit and Izta is yet to checked off the list, It\u0026rsquo;s been quite an eventful night. With sufficient rest at Portillo 1, I feel much better and literally run down the last section of this trail.

Several blogs pointed at exploring this region by doing the La Joya traverse which essentially gets one to the base of the Iztaccihuatl volcano. I head out this morning to Amecameca - a small quaint town to the east of Mexico City. The bus that left TAPO [Terminal de Autobuses de Pasajeros de Oriente] around 0700 only got to Amecameca by 0900. Should have left earlier! From there at the Centro, I was able to hop into a cab that got me to Paso de Cortes around 0930.\nI hit the trail without wasting any time. Izta looks pretty unassuming from here. About 30 minutes into the hike, Popocatepetl reveals its massive self, smoking out pretty tamely. As I tread my way up to La Joya, just as I pass the radio tower around 1045, I notice a small rattle snake slither across the path. I looked up iNaturalist a few days ago and knew this park did have a good bunch of snakes. Needles to say, seeing one slithering around did give me a good reality check. The last couple miles, I\u0026rsquo;m stuck behind a big group making their way up to La Joya. I initially planned to climb Izta upto Portillo 2. Getting to La Joya and seeing the crowd there, I decide to head back. Also, the scenery wasn\u0026rsquo;t changing much and I didn\u0026rsquo;t see great benefit in climbing the last half mile of the planned hike.\nNext time I come here, I\u0026rsquo;d probably make this a multi-day trip and camp at La Joya. Great hike overall but for the heat and crowd.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/01/28/la-joya-izta-volcan-hike/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to scout out the Izta-Popo national park ever since I got a sneak peek at the volcanoes while in Ikea a few months ago.

Gotta have that super neat Stamen map. I did get really close to setting this up sometime back but got left on the wayside.

Need to build that rule engine to automate some of those imports and reports.\nSnikket/Matrix/Slidge: Need to get this sorted out to be part of those groups that still rely on WhatsApp. I setup a bridge sometime back but deleted it because I was rarely using it. More of a nice-to-have so may not quite get to this anytime soon.\nMemories: Selective photo sharing with family or friends. Send a link instead of sharing photos individually. Love the nextcloud setup so far. Would be neat if I can take this up a notch.\nMusic: Kinda like my current Navidrome setup.

And also, this is painstakingly unrewarding work.\nEvery single day we\u0026rsquo;ve been behind those racks, we keep thinking - why would someone leave so much of surplus cable and more importantly leave it so disorganized? I believe the reasons are multi-fold. Experience (or lack thereof), workmanship issues, time constraints, personnel turnovers and culmination of several unintentional judgement calls is what comes to mind. And then it also strikes me that I\u0026rsquo;m probably making a heavy judgement without having exposure to the situation my predecessors were dealing with? There was probably a solid reason why they had left so much slack in the cable. We will never know. Ultimately we\u0026rsquo;re here and we\u0026rsquo;re working on this ‘mess’.

I\u0026rsquo;ve posted a few micro posts now and then, but nowhere close to chronicling things as much as I\u0026rsquo;d like to. This is a quick run down of a few things occupying my mind space:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been about four months since we moved to Mexico City. We absolutely love it here. People are terrific, weather is just right, and this city\u0026rsquo;s got a dash of almost every city we\u0026rsquo;ve lived in so far! M\u0026amp;S have been able to explore the regular tourist spots thanks to the CLO trips. I\u0026rsquo;ve joined them for a few, but what I really enjoy is just experiencing the city for what it\u0026rsquo;s got to offer - And there\u0026rsquo;s no dearth to that. Absolutely blown away by the city planning and the presence of so many parks. The city is spectacularly clean for the number of people living here. Every Sunday one of the main avenues is closed out to vehicular traffic and opened out to runners, cyclists and essentially anybody who wants to enjoy the roads. Amazed at the resources that the local government is able to draw from to sustain this every single weekend! We haven\u0026rsquo;t been that lucky to find decent vegetarian food here. Most local restaurants offer some form of meat in almost all dishes and the vegetarian items are rarely tasty. Dining out definitely leaves a lot to be desired - unless of course you try out other cuisines. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s good food out there - yet to find it though.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s exactly a year since I took on the current position. Best career move I\u0026rsquo;ve made so far, and I absolutely love every part of my job. There\u0026rsquo;s not one day that\u0026rsquo;s akin to another and I\u0026rsquo;m constantly learning every day. Most days just whizz by with constant troubleshooting on systems and processes. I\u0026rsquo;m barely at my desk for an hour a day. Tracing power and logic is so refreshing - The adrenaline rush that comes when you\u0026rsquo;ve found that nuanced fault in the system is addictive. The closest I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to this in the past was while writing code for enhancing functionality in one of my side projects. Ironic that it took me fifteen years to realize what I\u0026rsquo;m really good at - fixing things! And now I get paid to play with toys and travel the world. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance to travel to Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo and Hermosillo so far. These cities are so different from CDMX and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I get a chance to experience these regions of the country too.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been biking to work most days and doing the Reforma ride on the weekends. So good to be back on the saddle so regularly. Met a couple folks from a trail running group here last weekend and would love to join them whenever time permits. Over the next few months I would also like to visit the National parks around the city. Not having a car is kinda limiting but definitely not a big deal.\nAs a family, we\u0026rsquo;ve really gotten into playing Zelda - Breath of the Wild. We each have our own profiles and are at different stages of the game. This is fascinating, engaging and such a good way to spend time together while indoors. S enjoys the challenges and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing to see how good she\u0026rsquo;s gotten at the game. Definitely getting the Tears of the Kingdom really soon!\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t been actively tinkering with my home-lab. Mostly doing the bare essentials to keep it updated and running. I\u0026rsquo;ve started using FireFly III more actively to keep track of our expenses and for general budgeting. Since internet and power are decently reliable, I should probably move part of my home-lab over from MD to here.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2023/07/04/notas-de-mitad-de-a%C3%B1o/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWith quite a few things constantly evolving over the last several months, I haven\u0026rsquo;t actively paid much attention to this space.

A few hours of good rest at K\u0026rsquo;s place and we hopped back in the car at 0330hrs on Saturday morning to head to the trailhead parking. Getting to the trailhead early around 0530hrs, got us a couple serene hours of hiking up in the darkness - near freezing cold winds swishing by trees on the mountains, dim headlamps guiding us in the darkness, silence of the wilderness and just each other for company.\nOn the way up, folks making the traverse in the CCW direction warned of the white-out conditions they\u0026rsquo;d faced on the ridge. The very reason why we set out on this hike was to get S and J to experience a ridge hike, so I really hoped we could get to the ridge. Realistically though, it just didn\u0026rsquo;t seem like we would be able to. Once at the hut, we decide to push for Mt Lafayette\u0026rsquo;s summit and turn around. About 500ft in, conditions worsened super quickly and black ice on the stones made it super unsafe to head further. We turn around, make another quick stop at the hut and descend down the same trail to reach the Lafayette parking ground by 1245hrs.\n[gallery link=\u0026ldquo;none\u0026rdquo; columns=\u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo; size=\u0026ldquo;medium\u0026rdquo; ids=\u0026ldquo;51617,51618,51619,51620\u0026rdquo;]\nAll in all, despite the weather and not being able to summit and hike the ridge, this was a terrific hike.

It\u0026rsquo;s been more than a decade that we met in person and this impromptu plan was a refreshing ‘stage’ for us to catch-up on several things while we weren\u0026rsquo;t in the water. Ankur and I chanced on each others blogs way back in 2010 and our shared love for the outdoors has led us on several running and hiking trips over the years.\nAnother highlight of this trip was to witness part of a Bhootada Kola - a devil worship performance which is apparently very common in the coastal towns of Karnataka. We were pretty zapped after the surfing session and couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite stay beyond 00:30 to witness this in full. Also, on the way to this temple we randomly chanced on some pretty cool bio-luminescence. Other folks in the group had been out on Saturday afternoon to witness a qualifying ‘race’ for the Kambala - a buffalo race event again popular in these coastal towns. Would have been terrific if we could have made it, but there was just not enough time to fit this all in!\nSuper sore from all the paddling, surfing and swimming. A terrific weekend though and such great memories.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2022/02/28/mulki/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Arabian sea - shimmering bright orange with the diffused reflection of the dusking sun, was way too tempting. With strong currents and offshore winds, It\u0026rsquo;s been an intense couple hours. Not much wave riding for all that paddling. Before we called it a day, I decided to paddle one last time past the frothy whites and onto the swells.  For a few minutes, the water seemed super serene. Calm enough for me to visualize dolphins far in the distance. Folks who\u0026rsquo;d been here earlier in the morning had a good spotting and it would have been lovely to spot them now as the sun was slowly setting. And suddenly something didn\u0026rsquo;t seem that right. Another look at the water and I could see what I \u003cstrong\u003eshould\u003c/strong\u003e have caught a few seconds before. Even before I could properly pop on the board, the swell quickly built momentum and yanked the board off my feet. Gravity, raw energy, power that looks so beautiful on the surface and all that connects these, unforgivingly engulfed me in their churn and royally spat me on the beach after a few seconds - though what felt like eternity.

At this point, calls are not bridged. It otherwise works absolutely seamless. Not quite sure how long I\u0026rsquo;d use this.

Humanity constantly evolves from a quagmire of possibilities and there\u0026rsquo;s very little merit in looking in retrospect. I think the likelihood of a successful forecast can only be enhanced if we work with the factors in the present - not the past, not the future. The past is barely helpful and you\u0026rsquo;d rather not rely on those from the future. (Odd I say that after all those years I spent churning numbers as an actuarial analyst.) Ultimately what trumps is that humans find it really hard to delineate emotions from decision making. As much as you\u0026rsquo;d like to disagree, you see it in every realm - Medicine, Finance, Sports, Academics, Health just to name a few.\nIn 2016, we had a fascinating close call on I-15 S while heading towards New Haven. (Fascinating because, I learnt it the hard way and everyone who drives a car and has a floor-mat should be aware of this.) Accidents tend to give you that moment for retrospect and back then I jotted something similar to the thoughts I have today:\nThe proverbial – ‘Everything happens for a reason’ is just not true. I believe the human brain does a wonderful job in assigning a reason to the cause and quite conveniently this is always subtly and retrospectively done. In its quest to find reason, it ends up triggering neural connections that emotionally and logically seem reasonable. So when and how do we draw the line while making choices and how do you substantiate the choices you’ve made? Or is the whole premise that as a logical and emotional machine you’re feeding good and bad data (choices) as a stimulus to train the body to better react to unforeseeable situations in the future?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve taken quite some risky shifts in my career over the last decade. Most driven by what I felt at that very moment - Gut instinct. Absolutely none that I regret. And most have been very rewarding. So when it comes to making a choice at that critical moment, I try and keep retrospectives at bay. Every once in a while, I do catch myself careening from this golden rule.

A tad bit long but so worth the listen.\nThis episode teaches you a lot about the immune system, immune-brain interactions and offers 12 potential tools for enhancing immune system function. Dr. Huberman discusses how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.\nHe discusses the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes—not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And he reviews how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. Dr. Huberman discusses how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. He also discusses the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and he discusses how to increase glymphatic “washout” of brain debris during sleep.

The celebration across the colony is heavily dampened. Those old neighbors have moved out. Folks now use digital lights if at all they do light up their houses.

I\u0026rsquo;ll be more than happy to help.\nOver the last few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to setup a comprehensive and secure ‘handover’ document for my family - In case I cease to exist. My key priorities were it should :\nbe easy to update and maintain when I am alive be easy to reference and access when I am dead have multiple fall-back points Now, the most straightforward way to do this would be to have all the information on a secure spreadsheet or document. But that\u0026rsquo;s not fun! So I decided to use Trilium Notes for it. When it\u0026rsquo;s time, my wife has three options to access the support checklist a) Online via a secure portal/app b) Using a secure flash-drive c) Old school printed sheets\nI think this is something super easy to replicate. Leaving this out here should someone find it useful.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get up and running:\nGrab the Trilium desktop app from here and install it on your machine. If it\u0026rsquo;s the first time you are using it, it should prompt you to create a local account. You can sync this with the server app later if you need one. On first install, Trilium also installs a demo document. This is super helpful to understand how Trilium works. But for now, collapse the \u0026lsquo;Trilium Demo\u0026rsquo; folder in the left sidebar. Download my \u0026lsquo;Closeout html\u0026rsquo; template zip file. Right click on the \u0026lsquo;root\u0026rsquo; folder on the left sidebar and click \u0026lsquo;Import into\u0026rsquo;. Select the zip file you just downloaded and click on \u0026lsquo;Import\u0026rsquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s it! Update the template to your needs and export for backups. Maintaining and backups:\nTo encrypt the folder, just right click on and select \u0026lsquo;protect subtree\u0026rsquo;. Trilium provides you three modes of export - Zipped HTML, Zipped markdown and OPML. I prefer the HTML export since it can be used in isolation. Do note however that all notes lose their encryption when they\u0026rsquo;re exported out! Generic notes:\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used Trilium notes since it fits into my workflow. You should be able to import the template into any note-taking app. The template is obviously bare minimum and generic. Tweak/add based on your personal situation. I\u0026rsquo;ve intentionally kept my guidance instructions and passwords isolated since I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be printing them on paper. You could have them all in one place here in Trilium and secure the folder. If saving the files/backups on a flash drive, I\u0026rsquo;d strongly recommend you use VeraCrypt I am a reasonably healthy person with no alarming issues. But hey, you never know! I think it\u0026rsquo;s critical that your family has good guidance on how best to pick up where you left off. Think of this as the last parting gift. It took me about four years of procrastination and few spurts of action to get here. And I am so glad I did.

I\u0026rsquo;ll be more than happy to help.\nI recently installed Navidrome on an Odroid XU4 and configured Guacamole on my NUC. To access these applications securely on an external network, I setup a WireGuard tunnel and took this opportunity to learn how to use Caddy as a reverse proxy. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick walk-through:\nSetup the VPS:\nSince we need a VPS just to tunnel traffic, get a lightweight one from a reliable provider. After the regular server hardening, setup your first WireGuard peer. I chose to use this script . To route traffic from the external web, configure your DNS settings to point to the VPS and then setup haproxy on the VPS:\n## install haproxy sudo apt install haproxy -y ## setup the config sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg Get the proxy config from my gist here and make sure you edit the IP address at the end. Once that is done, close out the file and restart the service:\n## check config haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -c ## restart sudo systemctl restart haproxy.service With the above steps complete, you should have a WireGuard tunnel that\u0026rsquo;s ready to send traffic over to its peers.\nSetup your peers:\nInstall WireGuard on the device you\u0026rsquo;d like to connect to the external network. Since we\u0026rsquo;ve already setup the first peer [Server], we\u0026rsquo;ll just have to copy over the configs and update it for the other peers [clients]. There are quite a few guides out there that outline this. Happy to provide pointers if required. Once you the peer(s) up and running, make sure they can \u0026rsquo;talk\u0026rsquo; to each other :\nping -c 1 xx.xx.xx.xx\nGreat! Now we have the VPS and the WireGuard peers setup and talking to each other. Now on to routing the traffic. I would generally use Traefik for this. However, I wanted to explore caddy and this was a great test-case. I have docker containers running in DietPi on my Odroid-XU4. I spun up the caddy container using the below compose:\nversion: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; networks: web: external: true services: caddy: image: caddy:2-alpine restart: unless-stopped ports: - \u0026#34;80:80\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;443:443\u0026#34; volumes: - /home/dietpi/caddy/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile - /home/dietpi/caddy/data:/data - /home/dietpi/caddy/config:/config networks: - web And the Caddyfile below.\n{ # Global options block. Entirely optional, https is on by default # Optional email key for lets encrypt email updateme@domain.tld # Optional staging lets encrypt for testing. Comment out for production. # acme_ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory } app1.domain.tld { reverse_proxy containername:port } You\u0026rsquo;ll obviously have to tweak them for your needs. With all this set, you should now have functional access to your applications on the home-server externally!\nIt did take me a bit to figure out the moving parts. However, this was a fun exercise to tinker with caddy. Also I\u0026rsquo;ve been using the journal feature in Trilium to keep track of those hopping thoughts as I worked my way through setting this up.

With modifications to the python script, I think this can be extended further to fetch any type of data from the platform. Here\u0026rsquo;s a rundown of the publishing workflow so far:\nBluetooth Sync data from the watch to the Garmin connect portal. This is manual since I see no point in having Bluetooth turned on 24/7 Edit the activity in the Garmin connect app for say activity title, activity type or just add some more context to the workout A cron job runs on my website twice every week to trigger this python script in my WordPress plugin. I made slight modifications to the script so as to tie-in with my workflow. The python script connects to my Garmin connect account, pulls the latest three activities and saves them as JSON files on my server. The garmin-stats page when requested by a client, parses the JSON file for each activity and displays the content in a predefined format. There\u0026rsquo;s also a provision to publish a specific activity as an individual post. If I\u0026rsquo;m logged in WordPress, a \u0026lsquo;Publish this\u0026rsquo; button is displayed for activities that have not been posted yet. Currently I am assigning all of these posts to the \u0026lsquo;workout\u0026rsquo; category and I\u0026rsquo;ve disabled these from showing up on my main RSS feed. These posts however do show up on my micro-posts page. To-do\u0026rsquo;s:\nThe script currently triggers a \u0026lsquo;Garmin login alert\u0026rsquo; email for my account. Most likely because of locale settings. Would be good to mute these. The plugin code currently dynamically generates the summary page on 200+ JSON files. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably limit this to just 20 or so. Fetch non activity data too. Maps, charts, visualizations! Always scope for cosmetic tweaks!

With humans involved and the ensuing politics, money and power-plays; vaccines are built for the average human being. Then with anything manufactured and delivered at scale, we\u0026rsquo;re prone to Logistics and Supply chain Management issues. Covid19 vaccines are not a once and done deal. The effects last apparently at most a year. I did cave in and got the first ‘jab\u0026rsquo; of the Moderna vaccine today at the Consulate. As with all vaccines and medical interventions, this was not quite an easy decision. The decision was probably 40% gut, 40% trusting the mechanics of the mRNA vaccine and 20% of \u0026lsquo;Why am I even considering it\u0026rsquo;. The drivers for the gut-feeling likely being:\nGetting the vaccine would possibly break the link in transmitting the virus to an immune-compromised person. We live with our in-laws and that\u0026rsquo;s the least I can do for them. I consider myself to be a fairly young and healthy person and absolutely do not mind wearing masks and exercising social distancing. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve shamefully caught myself pulling down the mask during brief interactions with people. Despite best efforts, the masking system alone is not fool-proof. I need to be outdoors to stay healthy and be sane. Travel and Freedom are my primary \u0026lsquo;movers\u0026rsquo;. From an extremely exaggerated perspective, I see C19 as the Smallpox / Polio of this century. Few folks in the family are still reeling with the brutal after-effects of these diseases. I think I can take the risk of the possible side-effects for the marginal leg-up the vaccine might give my immune system in case I contract the virus. Folks in the family are leaning towards getting the Covaxin vaccine. India is having it\u0026rsquo;s worst wave so far and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping we swing back downwards as sharply as we rose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/04/16/jabbed/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSince March 2020, I\u0026rsquo;ve had this internal debate of getting the Covid Vaccine mostly underlined by the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3d3bb2ac73.65468826\"\u003escience behind mRNA\u003c/a\u003e is fascinating and so is the \u003ca href=\"https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3c8962f2a2.96282489\"\u003eengineering of the vaccine\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery strand of mRNA is made up of four molecular building blocks called nucleosides.

In this tutorial we will deploy a Trilium instance to install this open source and self-hosted alternative to Evernote on a fresh Debian server.\nPrerequisites\nTo get this running you would need\nA server with Docker and Docker-compose installed. There\u0026rsquo;s an easy step-by-step tutorial that you could follow. A domain pointing to the IP address of your server instance. The tutorial assumes you have pointed the domain notes.example.com to your server IP address. Step 1 - Setup Docker network and our work folder For ease of deployment and maintenance, we will use Docker in swarm mode. For security certificates and application mapping we will use Traefik as a reverse proxy. It\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine if you\u0026rsquo;ve not used these services before. All necessary steps to get them working are outlined in detail below.\nInitialise the docker swarm: sudo docker swarm init Setup a network for the Traefik container: sudo docker network create --driver=overlay traefik-net Create a directory where we will save all our stack yml files and navigate to that directory: mkdir stacks \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd stacks [](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-trilium-notes-using-docker#step-2--- categories:\nGuides coverImage: Trilium01.png date: \u0026ldquo;2021-04-06\u0026rdquo; tags:\nevernote-alternative\ntrilium-docker\nupdate title: Installing Trilium Notes \u0026mdash;create-the-yml-file-for-traefik)Step 2.1 - Create the yml file for Traefik\nCreate a yml file for traefik: nano traefik-ssl.yml\nCopy over the following contents into the yml file:\nversion: \u0026#34;3.7\u0026#34; services: traefik: image: traefik:${VERSION:-v1.7.24-alpine} ports: - { target: 80, published: 80, mode: host, protocol: tcp } - { target: 443, published: 443, mode: host, protocol: tcp } command: # - --debug # - --loglevel=INFO - --entryPoints=Name:http Address::80 Compress:true Redirect.EntryPoint:https - --entryPoints=Name:https Address::443 Compress:true TLS - --defaultEntryPoints=https,http - --providers.docker.endpoint=tcp://socket-proxy:2375 - --docker.swarmmode=true - --docker.exposedbydefault=false - --docker.network=traefik-net - --metrics.prometheus=true - --consul - --consul.endpoint=consul:8500 - --consul.prefix=traefik - --acme - --acme.onHostRule=true - --acme.storage=traefik/acme/account - --acme.acmeLogging=true - --acme.entryPoint=https - --acme.httpChallenge.entryPoint=http # - --update email - --acme.email=${ACME_EMAIL:-noreply@example.com} - --api deploy: mode: ${MODE:-replicated} placement: constraints: [node.role==manager] networks: - internal - traefik socket-proxy: image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro environment: CONTAINERS: 1 networks: - internal - traefik consul: image: consul:1.7.2 command: agent -server -bootstrap-expect=1 -client=0.0.0.0 environment: CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE: eth0 CONSUL_CLIENT_INTERFACE: eth0 CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG: \u0026#39;{ \u0026#34;limits\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;txn_max_req_len\u0026#34;: 2048000, \u0026#34;kv_max_value_size\u0026#34;: 2048000 } }\u0026#39; volumes: - ${VOLUME_PATH}consul:/consul/data networks: - traefik - internal volumes: consul: networks: internal: driver: overlay attachable: true traefik: external: true name: traefik-net Step 2.2 - Create the yml file for Trilium Create a yml file for trilium: nano trilium.yml Copy over the following contents into the yml file: version: \u0026#39;3.7\u0026#39; services: web: image: zadam/trilium:0.46.7 volumes: - ${VOLUME_PATH}trilium-data:/root/trilium-data deploy: labels: - traefik.port=8080 - traefik.enable=true - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:${DOMAIN:-notes.localhost} networks: - traefik volumes: trilium-data: networks: traefik: external: true name: traefik-net Step 3 - Deploy the stacks Deploy the Traefik stack: sudo docker stack deploy -c traefik-ssl.yml traefik Deploy the Trilium stack: DOMAIN=notes.example.com SCHEME=https docker stack deploy -c trilium.yml trilium Give the system a few minutes to fetch the docker images and setup and run the containers in the background. To check the status of the containers you can run the command: docker ps -a\nStep 4 - Finish the setup in your browser Navigate to notes.example.com in your browser. You should now be presented with the following options as shown in the image below: Select the first option and click \u0026lsquo;Next\u0026rsquo; Create a user account for your Trilium Notes instance in the next screen and you should be all set now! Conclusion With a few simple steps we were able to setup and run a good alternative to Evernote. You can even import your notes from Evernote if you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nGo ahead and explore your new setup! The Wiki is also very informative for what you can do next.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/04/06/installing-trilium-notes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI wrote this guide \u003ca href=\"https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-trilium-notes-using-docker\"\u003einitially for the Hetzner community\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0026rsquo;ve used GIMP - which is a fabulous photo editing tool. They have a nifty installer irrespective of which OS you use and have stood the test of time. There are a slew of different ways to arrive at the final product. This method has worked well for me over the past and based on your specific needs, you might have to alter a few settings.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s say you have the below image that you\u0026rsquo;d like to make PP\u0026rsquo;s out of and you\u0026rsquo;d like them to be 2\u0026rsquo;\u0026lsquo;x2\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; with other constraints laid out here. This one\u0026rsquo;s obviously a bad image to start out with, but should be a good test subject!\nIsolate and sanitize:\nIdeally, you\u0026rsquo;d want to get a good photo of the subject. Make sure s/he is standing against a light background and there\u0026rsquo;s sufficient uniform lighting on the face. If you\u0026rsquo;re not able to get that you\u0026rsquo;ll have to \u0026lsquo;sanitize\u0026rsquo; the image first. And here\u0026rsquo;s how we go about doing that:\nOpen the image in GIMP and scale the image such that the distance between the top of the head and the bottom of the chin is about 1.1875 inch [Midway between 1 inch and 1.375 inch - The specs that was mentioned in the Travel web portal]. To measure: Press \u0026lsquo;Shift+M\u0026rsquo; - This is the shortcut for the measure tool. Use the mouse pointer to measure distance. The measurements should be visible at the bottom. To scale: Navigate to \u0026lsquo;Image\u0026rsquo; on the top navigation bar and then select \u0026lsquo;Scale Image\u0026rsquo;. Change the Image size attribute to % and scale down to the requisite level. For instance, I had to scale down to 60% since my initial Head-chin length was about 50mm. Finally measure the resulting image\u0026rsquo;s head to chin length in pixels. In our test case this was 366 pixels after the scaling. So our DPI [Dots (Pixels) per inch] is 366/1.1875 ~=308. We\u0026rsquo;ll use this later to crop our image. 2. If your image does not have a uniform light background or has shadows [Like in our case] here\u0026rsquo;s how you digitally make the background white. Do note that certain agencies/services do not accept digitally altered images - So make sure you have some great lighting!\nSelect the Paths tool - Shortcut \u0026lsquo;B\u0026rsquo;. Use your mouse and make a path around the subject. Make sure you close out the loop at the end by pressing Ctrl. Convert the path to a selection by pressing on the \u0026lsquo;Selection from path\u0026rsquo; on the Path sidebar Press Ctrl+I to invert the selection and press Delete on your keyboard to erase the background. Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve cleared the background, export the image as a jpeg and save for further processing.\nCreate the 2\u0026rsquo;\u0026lsquo;x2\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; image:\nSince we have a 308 DPI image , The 2\u0026quot; x 2\u0026quot; image would be about [308x2, 308x2] pixels = 617x617 pixels. [Your values would obviously be different based on where you started!]\nTo crop out our 2\u0026quot;x2\u0026quot; image, click on the \u0026lsquo;Rectangular Select tool\u0026rsquo; - [Shortcut R]. Then on the \u0026lsquo;Rectangular Select\u0026rsquo; sidebar, check the Fixed checkbox and set the parameter to \u0026lsquo;size\u0026rsquo;. Also further below switch the \u0026lsquo;No guides\u0026rsquo; drop-down to \u0026lsquo;Center Lines\u0026rsquo;. Now click on the image and you should see a square box with central guide lines.\nMove the box and center it so as to fit the image well within the box. Finally, Right-click on the Image, select \u0026lsquo;Image\u0026rsquo; and then \u0026lsquo;Crop to Selection\u0026rsquo;.\nBuild the 4\u0026quot;x6\u0026quot; canvas:\nLets create a new image canvas to hold our 6 PP photos. Use the shortcut Ctrl+N to create a new image. Set the image size as 4\u0026quot;x6\u0026quot;. Open the advanced options and set the X and Y resolution to 308 pixels/in. While here you might also want to set the Fill option to White. Now that we have the base canvas ready, navigate to Image\u0026gt;Guides\u0026gt;New Guide(By Percent) and create two horizontal (33.33%,66.66%) and one vertical(50.00%) guide.\nNow switch back to the previous GIMP window that has the 2\u0026quot;x2\u0026quot; image. Select all with Ctrl+A, Copy with Ctrl+C, switch over to the 4\u0026quot;x6\u0026quot; canvas and paste it over six times with Ctrl+V. Move the pasted images to the individual boxes. The guides will help snap the the images correctly.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! You now have a stellar looking 4\u0026quot;x6\u0026quot; canvas that you can export to a jpeg/jpg format and print out on a matte photo card either at home or any of the external printing centers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/01/25/diy-passport-photos/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick and simple way to make and print your own passport photos[PP].

The house didn\u0026rsquo;t have robust walls - It just had a few curtains to protect us from the elements. The rooms internally had walls full of transparent glass. It was a beautiful property with lots of cross-ventilation and something that was just right for our family. Over time, more people moved in around us and it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel all that secluded. Visitors to the beach, neighbors and more so the property owner started getting more interested in our mundane lives. At times we felt, they were interested more in us than the pristine beach. The property owner started hiking the rent overtime and started charging us for random things. At one point, he even started deciding when we could actually use the beach. As much as we\u0026rsquo;d wanted to stay at that place and enjoy the neighbors company, we decided it was time to take things in control. We got out of the lease and built our own property in the adjacent lot. This time though we had beautiful bamboo walls and lots of open windows with blinds. We had complete control on whom we could connect with and more importantly when we really wanted to. We still had nothing to hide. However we did have everything in the world to protect. Times have changed and it\u0026rsquo;s no outsiders business to benefit from your matter of regular affairs.

I urge you to revert to the old-school world of blogging. Use an RSS reader - let the information come to you on your terms and not on algorithms that mine your data for someone else. Privacy in the current form is a hoax and it is time we lift the veil and make those small changes for the network-effect to take place. And trust me, it is so absolutely worth it once you clear the veil.

I value my freedom and privacy - way more than the perceived convenience and I\u0026rsquo;ve deleted my Whatsapp account for good.\nEver since FB bought Whatsapp in 2014, they\u0026rsquo;ve been working on building a feature-set that would keep users tethered to the network - read receipts, web clients, weeding out third party clients, voice calls, removing the 1$ annual fee, file sharing, encryption, desktop clients, video calls, customer service platform for enterprises, status, enhanced video call features - you get it.

I\u0026rsquo;m surprised they took 6 years to get here though.\nUsers currently have until Feb 8, 2021 to agree. Very few of the millions of users will end up deleting their accounts since most just cannot see beyond Whatsapp and the mainstream messaging platforms. Given its huge user base and the network effect, It\u0026rsquo;s terrifically socially engineered to keep you from moving out to other apps because of the perceived benefits. Also how do you move your family and then the extended network out of a system that is already so inter-twined? If most of your connections don\u0026rsquo;t move where\u0026rsquo;s the draw in moving out? And honestly, I would have probably stayed had they given me an option to opt-out of its most recent terms and conditions. As a business, I know you\u0026rsquo;re eyeing the honey pot - But hey, not at my expense, free will and something that you shove down my throat. Good riddance.\nI use(d) Whatsapp primarily to stay connected with close family. I\u0026rsquo;m coercing nudging them to move over to Signal / Delta-chat. Surprisingly, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that difficult to get them to move. I should have done this several months back…I created groups on Signal and shared those individual links in the Whatsapp groups that I was part of, left a message and immediately deleted my account not waiting for many responses or questions. Majority accepted and are now on Signal! And for those that don\u0026rsquo;t, there\u0026rsquo;s always the old school way of connecting via SMS/voice calls. My FB and Instagram accounts are in dormant mode for the last few years now and the only social space I\u0026rsquo;m ‘active’ is on this blog. Since moving over my RSS feeds to miniflux, I\u0026rsquo;m more actively following people\u0026rsquo;s blogs and find that way more enriching than mainstream media. I\u0026rsquo;m gunning on the premise that if someone really wants to get in touch with me, they will figure out how to.\nLove these digital resets. See you on the other side!\nPS: Before deleting your account, If you do want to archive your chat history, make sure you manually export and not backup all your chats prior to moving. The backup option on Whatsapp doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much since the messages are encrypted and Whatsapp deletes the backups too when the account is deleted.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/01/10/digital-reset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been sitting on the ledge for a while now and Whatsapp\u0026rsquo;s latest \u003ca href=\"https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ffaa21254e415.40990025\"\u003eultimatum\u003c/a\u003e is \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e what I needed to see myself out the doors.

A few GPS devices apparently had a mild(?) path offset issue few days ago:\nThe issue has to do with the ephemeris data file, also called the EPO file (Extended Prediction Orbit) or Connected Predictive Ephemeris (CPE). Or simply the satellite pre-cache file. That’s the file that’s delivered to your device on a frequent basis (usually every few days). This file is what makes your watch near-instantly find GPS satellites when you go outside.

This is the first time that I\u0026rsquo;m losing a hard-drive and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad I was prudent enough to have multiple copies.

If I did want to claim the warranty on the drive, I will have to send over the hard-drive to Seagate. I am just not comfortable sending it over now since technically, most if not all of it, can be forensically retrieved. On that thought while researching on possible encryption tools, I landed on VeraCrypt. I instantly formatted my backup drives, setup an encrypted container and pointed my selfhosted Nextcloud installation to that virtual \u0026lsquo;drive\u0026rsquo;. The initial formatting does take time since VeraCrypt replaces data bit-by-bit and creates a clean slate. Once that is done, decrypting the data is just a matter of seconds. While at it, I also subjected all my other hard-drives to SMART tests and badblock tests to make sure they were following suit!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been about two weeks and I am super impressed with the ease and functionality of Veracrypt.

Thankfully our mail-in-ballots arrived just in time and we sent those out a couple days prior to our departure.\nThe international leg was pretty comfortable and uneventful since the flight was only around 60% to full-capacity. The domestic leg from New Delhi to Chennai however was a bit iffy with a packed flight. Masks, visors, gowns and Oh - Humans! Shasta did really well - promptly wearing her mask whenever asked to and walking miles on the travelators in the New Delhi airport.\nUntil offices move into phase-3 of re-opening, I\u0026rsquo;ll most likely work remotely from Chennai. Definitely a blessing in disguise since we get to spend time with Meena\u0026rsquo;s family here. With so many folks around, Shasta\u0026rsquo;s going to be pretty occupied and difficult to catch! We\u0026rsquo;re obviously quarantining for Covid19 and we haven\u0026rsquo;t really meandered out. It\u0026rsquo;s the rainy season here currently and the weather\u0026rsquo;s been pretty bearable.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the digitized collection sorted by country.\nKitta Mama was Appa\u0026rsquo;s senior at work and our neighbor. He was well into his 70s and on those hot summer days, when we - the kids from the neighborhood would take a break from our outdoor play, he would tell us tales of his escape from Burma during the World War II. My interest in Geography and History grew solely because of him. He\u0026rsquo;s also the one who introduced us to his mega-collection of board games! One fine day in January 2000, he volunteered to drive me on his moped, to the Hospital where Amma was reeling back and forth in Coma. A speeding white ambassador accidentally(?) hit us from the rear and drove away from the scene. I was able to get him to the hospital but just not in time to save him. Those moments are etched in my memory forever and this gallery is a tribute to him and his never ending zeal to convey positivity, knowledge and wisdom.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/08/27/stamp-collection-digitized/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/Stamp-Collection-e1598479811502-1200x689.png\" alt=\"\"  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout two decades ago, I chanced upon a small collection of stamps from my Dad.

We\u0026rsquo;ve had some interesting discussions on Yoga and other things over the past week and I do think she has a ton to share! She\u0026rsquo;s also planning to train for a 50miler which I am super excited about! Oh and beyond all that marketing ploy, Happy Mothers\u0026rsquo; day.\nShasta\u0026rsquo;s talking a lot more now. Pretty sure her verbal diarrhea is soon going to start soon too! The other day, while sitting with Appa she said something to the effect of \u0026lsquo;i-pae\u0026rsquo; pointing to the ipad. Grandfather and daughter are totally connecting on these gadgets!\nGit: I agree on many levels with what Kev posted recently about Github. I enjoy working on and deploying software tools. What I do not enjoy is the whole git pull, push, fork thing!\nSessions: I am running a session later this week for the Khat-pat folks on self hosting. Planning to keep it mostly hands-on and crisp. The idea is to get them started on taking better control of their presence on the interwebs! I\u0026rsquo;d also love to join the Indieweb folks one of these days. They have one coming up on the 20th!\nTools: Earlier this week, I came across e-mail cloaking services - Simplelogin and Anondaddy. Love the idea and I might give them a shot the next time I subscribe or sign-up for a service.\nFeed Readers: Over the past few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve used multiple feed readers - Netvibes, TheOldReader, FreshRSS and Fever. They were all good in specific aspects but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really find them to be that one tool which I could use to consume the inter-webs my way. Earlier this week I decided to self-host one and narrowed down to FreshRSS, miniflux and selfoss. After a few iterations of deploying and testing, I stuck with selfoss. It\u0026rsquo;s super light-weight and has all the specific features I was looking for. To deploy it on docker, I used the boiler-plate template that I created earlier when setting up my known instance. The gist file for the docker-compose is here. The install should take you at most 10 minutes assuming you have the base framework setup. What I do love about selfoss is the ability to push articles over to my wallabag instance.\nTrilium: I\u0026rsquo;ve moved most of my notes over to Trilium and I am absolutely loving it! While it\u0026rsquo;s hierarchical, it is also setup not to be one.\nInteresting reads this week:\nTime-restricted eating: Philip referenced this article recently and I think it\u0026rsquo;s brilliant! Also went ahead and signed up for Rhonda\u0026rsquo;s podcast.\nTracking using ultrasound frequencies: Whoa! This totally blew my mind! If google uses it to connect your devices with chrome cast, what\u0026rsquo;s really stopping them from using it to track what you are watching? And now how do you block that invasion?\nWorkplaces in the era: Firms will have additional pressure from (or will be incentivised by) their insurance companies to have monitoring in place. Over the span of few months, this will be the new normal. Looking back, haven\u0026rsquo;t we all got used to keying-in and out at our workplaces?\nWe kill people based on metadata: Quite a lot is changed since 2014. What hasn\u0026rsquo;t though is how fragmented and withdrawn several government and private entities are even in times of crisis.\nThe mystic veil of End-to-End encryption: Interesting read on the data sharing between these apps. The other day I was wondering how Bark\u0026rsquo;s able to access messages from these apps. Likely they have something on these lines drifting underneath? While I love the concept of the app and the benefits it provides, I did cringe and walk away because I just wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how they\u0026rsquo;d be handling the data.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/05/10/weeknote-19-feeds-and-sessions/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA glimpse of the past week and the few things that captivated my attention:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeather\u0026rsquo;s been pretty erratic this week.

Having setup a robust docker framework earlier this year, I decided to test Trilium out. Gave it a test run this morning and am way impressed with its\u0026rsquo; functionalities! With docker, installation was super easy and I am strongly leaning towards using Trilium as my primary note application.\nThe yml file to get this running on docker (swarm) is in my github gist. You\u0026rsquo;d obviously need to have docker installed, docker swarm running with the traefik container and the domain mapped as needed. My Jitsi post has this outlined further.\nWhile I haven\u0026rsquo;t spent a fair amount of time diving deep into the setup, here\u0026rsquo;s a quick first impression:\nPros:\nBeautiful interface that can be as sparse or as detailed as you\u0026rsquo;d like it to be Encrypted by default and further protected sessions for sensitive notes A note-info section that details attributes and link-maps Notes can be \u0026lsquo;cloned\u0026rsquo; under multiple places in a tree Code scripting, tables, markdown, images, files - It\u0026rsquo;s got it all! Web clipper for quick screen and context grabs Export and Import functionalities Cons:\nNo mobile apps yet! However, it does have a mobile front-end which should be a good alternative No multi-user support yet I was exploring Joplin as an alternative initially but decided to stick with Trilium since the Joplin app currently has limited functionality (Creating nested trees in the mobile app). Meena\u0026rsquo;s been looking at switching over from her current Evernote setup and I think this might be a terrific replacement for her. Was never really a fan of Evernote and that dislike strengthened further when I had to install the app either on a Mac or PC to export my content!

Known is one of those apps and so the first step was to build that PHP environment.\nSetting up a Dockerhub repository and building a custom PHP image\n[If you decide to use my image, you would not have to build this yourself. Skip ahead to the Deploying Known section]\nMost php based apps also need specific extensions built-in. While I am sure they\u0026rsquo;re out there on the Docker hub repository, I was not able to easily find any images that met my specific needs [php extensions for gd, zip, pdo_mysql etc]. So I went ahead and setup my own repository on Docker Hub.\nSomething I learnt today was that a docker stack only accepts pre-built images. Which essentially means you cannot use the regular build command on the fly in your docker-compose file. A quick work-around to that is to build the image locally and then publish it to a public repository from where the stack can easily access it.\nCreate a dockerfile: sudo nano dockerfile Copy over contents from my dockerfile gist. Edit or update if you need any additional extensions. Do note that I am pulling a debian buster image here. An alpine image would be optimal but lets\u0026rsquo; run with this for now. Build the image locally: docker build -t sriperinkulam/php-7.4.3-apache-buster-plus:latest . Edit the image and tag name as needed. If your gist file is defined correctly, the image should be ready in a few minutes. It took me a few iterations to get this working with all the extensions I needed and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t give you any errors during the build process.\nLogin to your Dockerhub repo: docker login Push your image over to your repository: docker push sriperinkulam/php-7.4.3-apache-buster-plus:latest Within a few minutes, your image should be available for easy fetch whenever needed!

As Covid19 spreads across various countries, it\u0026rsquo;s influencing and compelling dire actions. What was considered to be impossible at various level, is now just a quick decision point - Financial stimulus, vaccine production, remote work and schooling to name a prominent few. As we build resistance to the virus as a society and consequently as the adrenaline that\u0026rsquo;s currently rampant drains out, we\u0026rsquo;re going to see the fallout\u0026rsquo;s of our actions or several inaction\u0026rsquo;s thereof.

Now, since my brother\u0026rsquo;s RPi4 was already exposed on the same network, I had to setup a reverse proxy on another RPi3 to access both simultaneously behind the router. Here\u0026rsquo;s the current setup:\nProxy server: An RPi3 running on Raspbian Buster Lite with HAProxy installed to handle the reverse proxy. Here\u0026rsquo;s the gist of the code that\u0026rsquo;s handling all the heavy lifting. Since SSL is handled by the other servers themselves, all I needed was a quick pass-through handshake from HAProxy.\nServer 01: An RPi3 running on NextcloudPi essentially serving Nextcloud for all my file needs. Data is simultaneously backed up on a couple machines within the network. Decided against a remote backup [S3/Backblaze] for now.\nServer 02: An RPi4 running on Diet-Pi and serving Pi-Hole and a Nextcloud instance. I\u0026rsquo;ve turned off DHCP on the Orbi router and delegated that to the Pi-Hole. Both the Pi-Hole and the router have static IPs assigned to the SBCs and my trusty Dell machine based on their MAC address. I\u0026rsquo;m debating if I should move the Pi-Hole over to the Proxy Server\u0026hellip;\nBeyond the home-lab, I have a droplet with DigitalOcean serving this website and a few other portals I manage. ServerPilot runs in the background on that droplet taking care of all the critical needs. I do intend to shift this over to a home-lab once I get hold of my ODroid XU4 which is currently in the Uganda shipment several thousand miles away in Chennai!\nEarly this year, I also procured a Hetzner cloud instance to test its stability and see if I could move over certain portals to it. Should say I\u0026rsquo;m pretty impressed! Running on Debian Stretch and powered by Yunohost, I installed PixelFed and Wallabag. Installation has never been any easier! One drawback for sure is that the code-base may be a bit lagged as it gets deployed on Yunohost. Nevertheless, it\u0026rsquo;s pure magic to see things getting installed with just a few clicks and not much back-end work.\nAnd then, I manage a Moodle Bitnami instance running on an AWS instance.

A 5k barefoot beach run on Tuesday, 5.5k lap runs at the YMCA on Wednesday, 25mins breaststroke swim at MBC and 30min MAS training at YMCA on Thursday, and a 2k barefoot beach run on Friday.\nMusic: Spent friday evening listening to a Veena instrumental performance at Narada Gana Sabha. A family friend was playing with 107 other artists and I also ran into a college friend with whom I was out of touch for about 10 years now! The performance was a tribute to his grand-father.

Just read this brilliant Nat-Geo piece on Netherland\u0026rsquo;s sustainable farming practices and how that\u0026rsquo;s setting them to success as the world\u0026rsquo;s second largest exporters despite being a really small country!

Interesting podcasts this week:\nNow that I don\u0026rsquo;t have a commute to work, I had to find ways to incorporate listening to podcasts during the day. Over the last couple weeks, I got back into the groove by tuning into podcasts while cooking.

Meena introduced me to Nat-Geo\u0026rsquo;s Overheard. With whale songs and scuba diving in pyramids, this channel does sound pretty promising. Interesting reads this week:\nThe Independent posted an article on how, many large ships were fitted with scrubbers to release gases into the ocean waters to circumvent pollution laws.

That lasted us for about 36 days; indicating a per day, per person use of about 37 liters. Way below what is consumed by an individual in the U.S on average - 400 liters. It hit me real hard when I noticed my sisters, who were visiting us in Boston a couple years back, turned the tap down close to a tickle to wash plates.

With most of my family in the states, this was one tough decision to take and it has been on our minds for the last three to four years.

Just as we were finalizing things back in the US, we\u0026rsquo;d realized that we would be having Shasta that year and decided to push the move to next year. Come 2019, once we had Shasta\u0026rsquo;s paperwork in place and she was ready to fly, we head back to Uganda to spend a few months there with Meena\u0026rsquo;s father and finally made our way to India with a short stay in Dubai.\nI resigned from WTW in April and decided to take some time off to spend with Shasta. She\u0026rsquo;s growing way too fast and I am beyond thrilled that I am able to spend some real quality time with her and Meena.

The security clearance is currently underway for over 10 months now and I am now cutting it wee closer to the September deadline. Fingers crossed!

There\u0026rsquo;s another opportunity in Maine, U.S. that I might explore a few months down the lane.\nThe rest of 2019 is going to be as fluid as the last few months have been and I trust things will start shaping out soon. The other day, I was telling Meena how straightforward this all looks in retrospect - we were mulling over it over several interspersed discussions across years and all it takes is a few hours for one to uproot, move and get settled to a new normal! Friends and family keep asking us if our move to India is permanent. We tell them it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;For good, for now\u0026rsquo;.

I still need to weed out some pesky issues but I believe I have the bearing right now.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my current setup:\nNexcloudPi installed on a Raspberry pi 3B+ board Yunohost installed on an Odroid XU4 board Diet-Pi installed on another Raspberry pi 3B+ board I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Nextcloud as my data storage solution for more than a year now. It does what I expect it to do and much more. NextcloudPi handles the intricate details and takes out the hassles that come with hosting data on personal servers.\nOn the ODroid-XU4, I installed debian stretch as the base OS and then manually installed Yunohost as my web server. I use ServerPilot on my Digital ocean servers and was looking for a close match while self hosting. Love YHs web-ui and they did seem to support quite a few web apps. I also have my eyes on cozy and caprover. Might explore these at a later point in time if decide to switch to a different SBC.\nBoth NextcloudPi and Yunohost have letsencrypt tools to setup and manage certificates for the domains/sub domains. While super useful, I realised to benefit from that feature, I had to rely on haproxy. With some pointers from the Nextcloud forum, I decided to use another pi to front as the main server. Installed Diet-pi on it since it\u0026rsquo;s just something I really liked and configured haproxy on it to map to the corresponding server based on the hostname. While at it, I also added in a switch between the router and various servers.\nI still need to work on making this more robust. One niggling issue is the speed is heavily compromised. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing it\u0026rsquo;s do with my haproxy config and I should be able to fix it pretty soon. Once I have this sorted out, I need to spend some time hardening the security of the server, further configure Yunohost, device my backup strategies and finally moving my websites over from Digital Ocean.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2019/02/26/bringing-the-cloud-home/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI finally got my Shoebox server setup working!

Earlier today (yesterday) Meena and I brought into this world a sparkingly beautiful 7lb 5oz girl. I remember seeing Meena during the institute at TFI with some of her school kids and thinking she would be a wonderful mother one day. Eight years from then, as I see this little munchkin in the crib beside her, I am more than thankful for all that has led to this day. I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled beyond limits.\nTara, Zara, Agni, Annapurna were all front runners for the name. With our mutual love for the mountains and belief that the name should exude power and confidence, we eventually zeroed in on Shasta. I first came across the name on a Dirtbag diaries podcast - Flying Deep. I profusely liked the way it sounded and the fact that Mt. Shasta was a towering, potentially active volcano sealed the deal.\nI\u0026rsquo;m psyched that we\u0026rsquo;re naming her after a mountain. While climbing up a peak or on the ridge, I always feel the eerie and calming sense of belonging. It always reminds me of days spent in the hospital living by the day\u0026hellip;a mixed bag of memories I so wish, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have, yet I\u0026rsquo;m so thankful I do\u0026hellip; Somewhere deep under I knew Amma wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make it. She\u0026rsquo;d been swinging in and out of consciousness for several months now. One of those lucky days in November 1999, her vitals seemed reasonably stable. She was longing for some fresh air and I was able to finagle one of the nurses to take us outdoors. We took amma on a wheelchair to the terrace of the hospital. It was a dark, chilly and breezy night. Hyderabad was just about wrapping up its Diwali celebrations. Far down where our vision could stretch, every now and then a rocket would shoot up and the fireworks would brighten up the sky. Amma was thrilled! As another waft of cold air blew on the terrace, amma clenched my fists and said \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never been this high on the mountains. This is the most beautiful sun rise I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen\u0026rdquo;. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take us a lot to figure out she was having yet another bout of hallucination. The last few months the medications were wrecking havoc. This time though on that terrace, I felt a sense of thankfulness. For this, was one of those moments when I could see that child-like sparkle in her eyes, something that would remain captured in my memories of her and something which I\u0026rsquo;d never see again\u0026hellip;forever. From that day, Mountains and more so sunrise on those ridges took a whole different meaning.\nA few days back, as we floated the name within the family circle, one of my cousin\u0026rsquo;s mentioned Shasta meant \u0026rsquo;teacher\u0026rsquo; in Sanskrit. Meena and I met through a teaching fellowship and I thought it was pretty awesome that we ended up naming our kid - Shasta! Shasta, also happens to be a reference to a south Indian Hindu deity that my ancestors have long worshiped. All in all we seem to have appeased all generations!\nFor the middle name we decided to just leave it as R, depicting Ratna - amma\u0026rsquo;s name, Rajesh - a dear cousin of mine who committed suicide a few years back and Ramu anna - another cousin who very recently passed away fighting cancer. The hope is that we\u0026rsquo;re saliently reminded of them all through Shasta.\nWhile I can\u0026rsquo;t quite foresee the future, I believe we do have in mind the kind of person we would like to raise. The world at this point in time has a lot of negative things going on. We hope as Shasta grows and develops a personality of her own, she does so much more than what we\u0026rsquo;ve done to bring in more positivity around her.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2018/11/20/shasta/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s about 2 AM and I am on a side bed in Sinai Hospital.

I\u0026rsquo;d just heard about Ubuntu Snappy Core OS and was keen on porting my install to that setup. I finally got around doing that last week and thought I\u0026rsquo;d quickly jot down the install steps for reference later. Essentially, I installed the Core OS on a 32GB microSD card and installed Nextcloud as a snap. Two 1TB hard drives service the Pi3 and are synced with rclone. Below is a crude outline of the setup:\nInstall and sign-in to the UbuntuCore OS:\n1.Download the latest Ubuntu Core OS and use Etcher to burn it on to a microSSD card.\n2.On your local machine generate a public/private rsa key using the following command: ssh-keygen -t rsa Create an UbuntuOne account if you don\u0026rsquo;t already have one and import your ssh key to your account. You\u0026rsquo;ll need this to ssh into your Core OS pretty soon.\n3.Slide in the microSSD card onto the Pi3 board. Then connect a monitor, keyboard and hard drive to the Pi3 and power it on. The Pi3 Board B comes with in-built wi-fi and bluetooth and once powered on it should automatically prompt you to connect to the wi-fi and then to your UbuntuONE account. Once this is setup, you should be able to ssh into the CoreOS from your local machine using: ssh ubuntu-username@192.168.0.xx [btw] If ssh fails - \u0026ldquo;Error - signandsend_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation\u0026rdquo;. This is most likely because the ssh agent is already running but isn\u0026rsquo;t able to find the private keys. To add the keys to the authentication agent, enter ssh-add. Also to see list of fingerprints of all identities added use ssh-add -l [/btw][btw]To add a password for the user: sudo passwd ubuntu-username[/btw][btw]To re-configure network at anytime: sudo console-conf[/btw]\nExternal Drive setup 1.I use two external hard-drives one as a primary and the other as a secondary.

Had a 27 pound backpack on and felt every ounce of it on my spine as we hiked up Moosilauke on Day 1. With a thunder shower forecast for the weekend, we had one person drop out from the team just the night before the trip. After the initial meet at the Appalachian Trailhead on NH-25A, eight of us packed in two cars head towards the Beaver Brook Trailhead at Kinsman Notch on NH 112. Started the hike at around 09:30hrs up the Beaver Brook trail.\nWasn\u0026rsquo;t quite feeling too well as we made the initial push. With about 3000 ft of elevation gain in the first two miles, I already had some serious second thoughts on this trip. Decided to take it slow on the way up and take a call once I reach the summit. Plan B was to make my way back to Beaver Brook shelter and rest there while the rest of the team traverses the Appalachian trail and make their way down south towards the Gilmans corner AT trailhead on NH 25A.\nSkirting around Mt. Blue we reached the Mt. Moosilauke summit at around 13:30hrs. Lucked out on the weather and had some beautiful 360 degree views. Some pretty good views of Franconia notch, Mt. Washington and several other peaks! Eventually decided to head below tree line and make our way down on the AT towards Jefferson Shelter. Incessant rain and the steep down gradient took a good toll on the knees. Reached the shelter at around 17:15 dripping wet. Setup the tent in the rain and was totally knocked out in a few minutes.\nMet Chief and Doc - two septuagenarians, one with Parkinsons and the other a veteran who\u0026rsquo;ve been hiking the AT together every year for the last 40 years! Some great trail talk and we leave the next day morning south bound. My knees weren\u0026rsquo;t doing that great and I decided to bail out once we reach NH 25C, about 5 miles from the shelter. Urged the rest of the team to continue on the trail for the next five miles. After about a 3 mile downhill run on route 25C, an elderly gentleman stops by the side and agrees to shuttle me to the start point. Hitchhiked for the first time ever in the U.S and was an interesting car ride! A french teacher in a school in NYC who\u0026rsquo;s settled in Warren. His wife runs a shop up in Loon Mountain and someday when I get there, I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure to check and connect the dots. Quickly change in the car and rush back on the trail north bound to meet the rest of the team. They apparently met a trail angel who was serving hot omelettes and muffins!\nA great weekend in the whites.

Thankfully, the Rav4 handled the conditions insanely well.\nA few kilometers in, direction signs to the camp lead us to the camp site. Looks like we\u0026rsquo;re the only two folks who\u0026rsquo;d be zip-lining today. Setup by Aaron Blanchard a US Peace Corps volunteer in 2014, the Mabira forest canopy super skyway is a phenomenal way to explore one of Central Uganda\u0026rsquo;s rainforests. After a short 15 minute walk in the woods from the campsite, the \u0026lsquo;Sky Captains\u0026rsquo; guide you up a ~40 ft tree from where you zip-line across the forest on five zips with the last one being a controlled repel between two 115 foot trees across the river Musamya. I\u0026rsquo;ve zip-lined a few times before, but never in a forest this high. Richard and Gerald - Our Sky captains did a terrific job showing us around and securely navigating us on the trees. Once off the zip system, Gerald led us to Griffin falls and then back to the campsite.\n[embed]https://vimeo.com/260921681[/embed]\nRiver Musamya is heavily polluted by the Sugar factories upstream. Mabira forest by itself is on the cusp of heavy deforestation. The Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited (SCOUL) - Jointly owned by the Government of Uganda and The Mehta Group apparently planned to clear one-third of the forest area to create sugarcane plantations in 2007. With resistance from local non-profits and environment groups the government is seemingly caving in. Very recently, it announced to buy-out the mabira forest residents. With all things environmental, politics and business we\u0026rsquo;d never really know where this balance is going to tilt.\nOn our way back, a guy from a village asked us to pull-over and checked if we could give him a ride to Lugazi. We were neutral but politely said we couldn\u0026rsquo;t. One of those times where you never really know what\u0026rsquo;s the right thing to do in a foreign place\u0026hellip;Also, there apparently has been an underlying racial tension against Asians here since the Mehta group is an Indian firm and the Chinese too do seem to have a strong presence in the Sugar business.\nOn the drive back to Kampala, It struck me why I really like travelling or doing things outdoors.

The first-aid course did get my attention. One of those things that I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to do for quite sometime now but never got around taking the time and effort to work on.\nWell, not anymore! Early this month I attended a wilderness first-aid (WFA) certification course organized by NOLS. It was a short yet extremely insightful course on responding to different situations one might encounter while deep in the wilderness. The course was more aligned to situational leadership and had several elements on training your mind to work on a methodical and well thought through set of actions [The SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan) approach apparently pretty commonly used in the medical field]. We were also introduced to regular first-aid skills for patient care and some basic wilderness survival do\u0026rsquo;s and dont\u0026rsquo;s.\nWith day long sessions and several practical scenario try-outs this was one long rewarding weekend. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to make sure I practice those skills intermittently just so I don\u0026rsquo;t forget them. To delve deeper, I\u0026rsquo;ll possibly sign up for the Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course sometime later this year.

With the full moon just starting to wane out, it was going to be a beautiful bright night. I was psyched, Miss Me was almost convinced, and now all that was left to alter the plan was to check with Keshav and Chaitra. A few hours later the weather report predicts thunderstorms and with that our overnight hike plans go kaput. We decide to stick with the original plan to head out of Boston at 0400 the next day morning. Chaitra decides to take a rain-check on the hike, so Miss Me and I head over to Keshav\u0026rsquo;s place late that night.\nWe hit the road by 04:15 next day morning. With dense fog, most likely because of last nights\u0026rsquo; thunderstorm, the drive up to NH is starkly different from last time. Around 06:40 we start on the Falling waters trail. I anticipate reaching the first switch-back in around 45 minutes but I\u0026rsquo;m pleasantly surprised that we come across it in just about 20 minutes. As we slowly trudge up the falls and across the streams, Meena and I are reminded of the time we spent here in July; pitch darkness with just two headlamps trying to find the path back to the start point. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible how the mind\u0026rsquo;s able to connect situations so lucidly\u0026hellip; We soon cross the horse\u0026rsquo;s tail waterfalls and from here, as expected, the trail gains elevation pretty quickly. At about 10:00 we reach little haystack.\nThe ridge looked so fierce, yet so welcoming. Dense fog considerably reduces the vision and we could barely see a few feet ahead. The intermittent heavy wind gusts made the ridge walk even more enticing. As we phase in and out of the clouds, an elderly couple tag along. Some fun exchanges and they recommend we hike Mt. Carrigain and the Owl\u0026rsquo;s head. Taking a mental note we head on towards Mt. Lincoln and then Mt. Lafayette.\nThis time around the climb up Mt. Lafayette felt much shorter. I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember it being this easy while scaling down the peak last time we were here. Must be the weather! Just as we\u0026rsquo;re summiting the peak, a lady and her son mention that a group was hoisting the flag up on Lafayette. We\u0026rsquo;re just in time! Up on the peak we learn apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a tradition now and a flag is hoisted on all 48 4000 footers in New Hamsphire on the weekend close to September 11th. We\u0026rsquo;re lucky we got to be up here just around the right time!\nPretty soon we decide to head down the peak to the AMC Greenleaf hut. Devour some ridiculously tasty hot soup and make our way down the Old briddle path to the parking lot by 1530.\nHaving done this loop from both directions, I feel the OBT-\u0026gt;FWT direction was definitely more challenging. Today\u0026rsquo;s hike however was a totally different experience when compared to the one we did in July. Was it the weather, Was it just our pace? Or was it just the whites?

Proximity to water made it an easy decision. A short 2 hour drive from home and we reached the state park around 09:00am.\nThe trails turned out to be much shorter than anticipated. Covered the whole state park in about an hour. Pretty well maintained. Humid conditions were a great recipe for the bugs though! Having covered the trails we head out to the beach. Pretty calm with just the morning walkers.\nSpent a few minutes here and we decide to head back to the car. Since it was only around 10:30, the restless me offered to drive to the White Mountains to hike the Falling waters trail. Would have been a splendid choice but for the drive time. We had to head west for about two hours, and then another two hours south to head home. Decided against it and navigated to Green Elephant for lunch. Splendid food, as always!\nAs we decide to head home, David responds to a text I sent earlier in the day. Checks if we would be interested in a \u0026lsquo;breath session, followed by Sauna and Jacuzzi\u0026rsquo; meet. Only he could come up with something like this! We instantaneously take up the offer and decide to meet at the Regency hotel in Portland. With about a couple of hours to kill we decide to head to the East End beach. As we\u0026rsquo;re walking by the East end promenade, we notice a bunch of kayakers heading to a fort. One look at Miss Me and she understands what\u0026rsquo;s reeling in my mind. We head to the boat rentals and check if we could rent a kayak. Figuring we didn\u0026rsquo;t have much time we book a sunset tour at 05:30pm instead. Spend the remaining hour just sitting by the water.\nZoom in and you\u0026rsquo;d notice this grand old man kayaking in an inflatable. Was a treat to see his wobbly body pivot into the boat, losing and eventually gaining balance. As he slowly head into the waters, the satisfaction of avoiding a flip brimming in his eyes, gets etched into my memory. Freedom.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s 14:00 hrs. We decide to head to the hotel to meet David. He\u0026rsquo;s right in time. Apparently this is his daily regimen. Works out in his Gym and fits this in before he heads back for another workout. We head straight to the Jacuzzi, then the Sauna followed by a cold shower and then repeat it thrice all over. The hot-cold shocks apparently flushes the body and the mind. I\u0026rsquo;m jealous he gets to do this EVERYDAY! It\u0026rsquo;s always so inspiring talking to David. Totally one of a kind! A quick stop at a gelato place and we head back to the East end promenade just in time for the Sunset tour.\nWe have a decently big group. Henry, our guide does a wonderful job showing us around. He\u0026rsquo;s moved all the way from Wyoming for his bachelors in economy and arts. Apparently got into Kayaking a few months back to make some income while he works on setting up an art studio with a few other friends.\nLooped around these awesome Osprey nests and head back towards the start point for some sunset views.\nBack on land, Henry suggests we visit Kettle Cove, Mackworth Island and Morse Mountain if we end up in this area some point in time. Given today\u0026rsquo;s experience, It\u0026rsquo;s highly likely we will get back here pretty soon. We head back to Portland downtown and decide to dine at Boda, Green Elephant\u0026rsquo;s sister restaurant. Oh so very Thai and delicious!

All that I had visualized about this supposedly treacherous hike was flipped all over. Most likely due to the weather, which was was way too perfect! It actually made it feel much easier than the Franconia Ridge trail hike we did last weekend!\nReached the trailhead and started the hike promptly at 07:00am on Saturday. Hiked up the Ammonoosuc ravine trail that slowly winds up by the Ammonoosuc river.\nWithin about an hour we were at the Gem pool.\nPretty much beyond this point, the trail gains considerable elevation and finally lands you on the AMC lakes of the clouds hut.\nSome points on this stretch were a bit tricky but nothing too demanding. Rain or fog would probably make this a bit challenging.\nWith the sun shining pretty bright and almost no winds all through, the climb was more of a mildly intense workout than anything else.\nThe summit is visible on the left as you climb up to the hut.\nA quick stop at the hut for some tailwind shots and sandwich pops and we hit the 1.4 mile Crawford path to summit Mt. Washington.\nA bold warning sign warns of the inclement weather up on the summit. However, today\u0026rsquo;s weather makes it a no-brainer to surge forward. The wobbly rocks make it a bit tricky. We reach the summit at around noon and spend about an hour up there.\nWith the weather being pretty good the Cog rail was flooding the peak with quite a few folks.We soon start making our descent.\nThe Gulfside trail which leads up to Mt. Jefferson (which we decide not to summit today) crosses the Cog rail line that goes all the way down to the Marshfield station.\nAs we descend we come across quite a few rail coaches that are sluggishly making their way up and down the line. Makes for a fun distraction as you try and find food placement on the stone riddled path.\nPretty soon we hit the Jewell trail which would eventually get us off the \u0026lsquo;ridge line\u0026rsquo;, back into the woods and finally down to the parking lot.\nWith infrequent stops we close out the loop at around 04:00pm. The Jewell trail ends across the parking lot, right off the Base Station road.\n9.5 miles in 8+ hours with an elevation gain of about 3500 ft. Not too bad.

I sprint ahead and heave a sigh of relief when I notice the \u0026lsquo;Old Bridle trail\u0026rsquo;[OBT] signboard high up on a tree. This confirms this is \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; bridge that we\u0026rsquo;ve been looking out for, for the past few hours and that the trail head should be a few hundred feet away. Meena suggests Jyothsna and I shoot ahead while she and Sanjana would follow behind slowly. With just one headlamp we make our way as fast as possible to the Lafayette camping ground parking lot. As we turn round the corner, we hear a concerned and loud \u0026lsquo;PS, PS?\u0026rsquo; cry. I\u0026rsquo;m relieved to hear Praveen\u0026rsquo;s voice and as soon he checks all four of us are safe he drops the bomb-shell. Having reached the trail head around 6pm and not hearing from us since then, he apparently had called in a search and rescue operation for us about 30 minutes back. My excitement on \u0026lsquo;finishing\u0026rsquo; the hike is short lived as I think to myself - \u0026lsquo;This is not over yet\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;. The last 20 hours have been draining, mentally more than physically. What should have been a decent eight hour hike has gone way beyond my initial estimation. Over the rest of Sunday, as we let everything sink in, Meena and I continue to hash out what possibly could have led up to this and what we should do to avoid this from recurring in future hikes.\nThe plan was to take a quick break at the AMC Greenleaf hut [4200\u0026rsquo;] that was 2.9 mi from the parking lot [1780\u0026rsquo;] and then summit Mt. Lafayette [5260\u0026rsquo;] that was 1.1mi from here. From there on we\u0026rsquo;d hit the Franconia ridge trail to reach Little Haystack[4760\u0026rsquo;] summit via Mt. Lincoln [5060\u0026rsquo;]. To close out the 9 mi loop we\u0026rsquo;d eventually take the \u0026lsquo;Falling waters trail\u0026rsquo;[FWT] from Little Haystack to the parking lot that\u0026rsquo;s about 3.2 mi mostly downhill. On average it should take about 7 hours to finish this 8.9 mile loop.\nOne of the prime reasons\u0026rsquo; for us to leave Boston this early was to make sure we had ample time to cover the ridge and get back prior to night fall. As we trudged our way up the OBT, Praveen seemed to have significant difficulty keeping up. As we gained elevation and the vistas opened up, we stopped quite a few times on the way. Knowing we had time at our disposal, we decided to slow down the pace and finally reached the AMC Greenleaf hut around 12:45pm.\nA longish break here and we hit the 1.1mi Greenleaf trail to summit Mt. Lafayette. The weather was just right and the wind and thin air seemed to lighten things a bit. Going with the flow, Meena and I had an amazing time running up the trail. Later after waiting for close to 20 minutes, I urged Meena to head up to the summit while I head back down to check on the other folks. I finally see them a few hundred feet below and ran down the trail to see if they needed any help. Praveen apparently did not want to proceed further and felt more comfortable heading back. I nudged him a bit to reconsider his choice and realised he\u0026rsquo;d already made up his mind. The question now was should I get the whole group down or just let him head back while we finished the loop. Jyothsna was in two minds, while Sanjana seemed determined to complete the loop. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite concerned with Praveen getting back to the parking lot safely. He knew the trail now, had time at his disposal and could always pick up some replenishment\u0026rsquo;s from the hut. Also in the rare situation that he needed help, there were quite a few folks doing the reverse loop. The decision was made. I handed back his coat and gave him my headlamp and whistle just in case he doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it before nightfall. The three of us make our way up to the Mt. Lafayette summit and catch up with Meena who\u0026rsquo;s already been here for close to 30 minutes now.\nWe soon leave Mt Lafayette and hit the ridge trail to make our way down south to Little Haystack. The ridge between Mt Lafayette and Mt. Lincoln had some technical downhills. This stretch would probably be a bit tricky had the weather worsened but gives some astounding views of the White mountains and the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The elevation, views and weather conditions remind me of the western ghats back in India. It hits me real hard that this is the first significant (comparable in terms of elevation profile) hike I\u0026rsquo;ve done since leaving India four years ago and rekindles some good old memories!\nMeena and I run down the ridge and wait for Jyothsna and Sanjana to catch-up. Sanjana seems to be having some issues with her toes and isn\u0026rsquo;t quite able to keep pace. We finally make it to Little Haystack around 05:30pm. Quite aware that we still had 3.2 mi to cover to make our way back to the parking lot, we quickly grab some sandwiches and hit the FWT.\nWe could see the parking lot from Haystack but going by the current pace looked like we\u0026rsquo;d make it there only around 10:00pm. Sanjana\u0026rsquo;s phone seemed to have some reception and we sent Praveen a quick voice and regular message mentioning our ETA. Sanjana\u0026rsquo;s toes\u0026rsquo; weren\u0026rsquo;t getting any better and the steep downhill on the rocky trail made things worse. The likelihood of us getting to the falls before nightfall was pretty low but we really wanted to give that a good shot. With two headlamps and a decent supply of water we slowly made our way downhill. Things went down south once it got dark. Jyothsna started getting ancy about Praveen and with reduced light, our pace reduced drastically. With close to 12 hours on foot and the end never seeming near, morale was extremely low. The barely visible dark blue trail markers on the trees made things worse. At several locations, I had to go ahead to make sure we were on the right path and then head back to re-group and follow the trail.\nAfter what seemed like eternity, we finally heard some water gurgling. Though this meant we were nearing the intersection where the OBT and the FWT merged, it added some more complexity. The FWT had quite a few switch-backs getting us to cross the river stream several times from bank to bank. Meena mentioned another hiker warned her of this while on the ridge. The rocks were slippery and the access points a bit tricky to maneuver in the dark. Had it not been for the thought that Praveen would be waiting for us (hopefully) at the parking lot, I would have voted camping at the river bed till dawn break.\nAt around 11:30pm we finally come across two other hikers coming from the opposite direction. They tell us the parking lot is about 45 minutes away. With some renewed energy (and no other option!) we finally make it to \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; bridge and eventually to the parking lot.\nPraveen gives us a low-down of his search and rescue alarm. Apparently he never received the message we sent him. As we try to call the police to try and get them to stall any initiated attempts, a NH Fish and game law enforcement vehicle drives in to the parking lot. The officer checks if everyone is safe and injury free and then radio\u0026rsquo;s in to the search party that we\u0026rsquo;re safe. After some formal procedures and protocols he mentions\u0026rsquo; we\u0026rsquo;re good to head back home and will hear from them later if required. We head back towards Boston and finally reach home around 05:30am.\nMeena and I keep discussing and reliving the last several hours over the rest of the day. We figured we had to come up with measures to avoid this from recurring in future group hikes.\nPrior to the hike: [x] Share emergency contacts and communication protocols. [x] Apprise each team member of individual medical needs. [x] Share hike details [Terrain, directions, landmarks, routes etc] with each team member. [x] Check on each members prior experience with the difficulty and endurance level of the hike. [x] Check on mandatory equipment - Headlamps, tents, Sleeping gear etc. [x] Set time and distance checkpoints to determine turn-around points if necessary. [x] Determine team break-out protocols.\nWhen looking back at the hike this weekend, I could easily see the stark failure-points right from the start. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of anyone\u0026rsquo;s general fitness levels. I did not collect and share emergency medical and contact information. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have a communication protocol. We should have taken a realty check at the Greenleaf hut for distance and pace. I should not have left Praveen head back alone. Most importantly, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a plan B!\nIronically, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing ALL of the above while organizing hikes for HydVentura. This hike would remain truly memorable not just for the splendid ridge-line views but for the gross failures at several levels in organizing it. Despite the shortcomings, I\u0026rsquo;m amazed at how each one handled the situation they were thrown in. Praveen was rational enough to turn around when he knew his body couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle the stress physically. After an initial breakdown, Jyothsna kept her calm as we maneuvered the trails and falls in the dark. Sanjana kept going despite being in deep pain and tried her best to keep up with us as we pushed ahead. Meena was impeccable in keeping the group morale high and playing lead-sweep seamlessly as and when needed. Things could have been way difficult had even one of us buckled down\u0026hellip;\nAfter a 5 year hiatus of organizing long distance hikes for big groups, it feels good to be back in this space. This hike would remain etched as a classic realty check. Looking forward to the Mt. Washington hike later this weekend. And now we know what not to do!\nSrikanth Perinkulam\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2017/07/26/franconia-ridge-hike/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSometime around midnight we reach a bridge with one side of its\u0026rsquo; railing non-existent.

Just that Miss Me did not hop on the ferry and decided to head home with me. She was to volunteer at the Nantucket Yoga festival which she attended last year and had a real good time.\nToday morning she just didn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;feel\u0026rsquo; like being there and we decided to head back. Staying back should also give her more time to spend with Shebs as she prepares for her upcoming ICC matches. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a busy few weeks ahead and this weekend is most likely the only one, that the girls get to spend time together for some time to come now.\nEarly this year Miss Me and I committed to not doing activities unless we truly and really want to do it. A conscious effort to spend more quality time taking part in different things that enrich our experiences rather than \u0026lsquo;going with the flow\u0026rsquo; and letting things \u0026lsquo;bloat\u0026rsquo; our weekend calendar.\nOn that note, we have some pretty exciting weekends coming up. Later today I\u0026rsquo;d be driving over with my cousins to the Poconos for a good long session of white water rafting. Back to the frothy waters after 9 years. Pretty excited! Next weekend I plan to volunteer and/or pace overnight at the Vermont 100mile run. Last year while volunteering at Camp 10 Bear, I ended up pacing a runner who had lost his pacer. With the heavy thunderstorm, pitch black darkness and my first time pacing, I was absolutely blown away that night. In several ways, that experience transformed my outlook towards running long distances and sub-consciously pushed me to train for a 50 miler. This year we\u0026rsquo;d also be taking over some delicious vegan blondies for the runners. Can\u0026rsquo;t wait! For the July 22nd weekend we plan to hike the Franconia ridge trail with a few friends from TFI and elsewhere. This one is an attempt to dive back into my hiking endeavors. I miss those days of organizing hikes for big groups and so badly want to get back to it. Later this year, a trip to Acadia, a visit to at least one national park in Canada and long day hikes in and around the White Mountains is something that\u0026rsquo;s on the cards too.\nTen years back I was a maniac putting in long hours during weekdays just so I could keep my weekends free to explore the trails out there. Something that truly kept me going! I think I\u0026rsquo;m back to doing that now. Just that there\u0026rsquo;s a much better balance.\nSrikanth Perinkulam\nlike reply repost\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2017/07/07/hyannis-notes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAn early morning drive to Hyannis (almost) and back.

And it feels terrific! Logged a good sixteen odd miles back in the trails after a month’s rest and met a good bunch of folks. It’s always so inspiring to attend these TARC meets. Last year at the camp, it was my first ever deep exposure to TARC and I was blown away by the positivity, humbleness and expanse and depth of knowledge these (ultra)runners and other campers brought in. What really makes TARC outstanding is its inclusivity and support framework. They’re open to anybody who is remotely interested in the outdoors and just let the sheer culture of this community take over the reins.\nIn hindsight, that experience at camp last year deeply impacted my outlook towards running. From barely training for any of the half and full marathons and winging them for the most part, I diligently trained for a 50 miler early this year. The primary intention was to understand my body better and get into a better fitness regimen. Pretty ironic that I ended up spraining my ankle badly during the main event and had to drop out. A run for which I’d logged more than 300 miles in training! Endurance has always been my forte and however arduous it be, I have never ‘given-up’ during a run/hike over the last ten or so years that I’ve been exploring outdoors. As I was walking back to the car that day, I was in second thoughts if I should have pushed it and completed the run. Something that I didn’t have a definitive answer for then and neither do I have now. All I knew was that my morale did take a beating for sure. Wapack and Back remains an unfinished business and I will have to get back on those rolling peaks to make peace.\nThe camp this weekend was a much needed fix. Just being there surrounded by folks who have DNF’d before consciously for practical reasons and physical limitations took some load off my shoulders. Overall I believe I also had good quality runs this weekend. I felt much stronger on the trails and my average pace definitely seems to have gone up. I can’t wait to get back to a good training regimen again. I definitely do want to make it to more of the weekly runs at the Fells and should also probably join the Blue Hills group whenever feasible.\nAs a more tangible target, I have my eyes on the StoneCat 50 miler this November. The India trip may be a mild deterrent but I think I should be able to find a way around that…\nSrikanth Perinkulam\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2017/06/12/tarc-camp-2017/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBack from the \u003ca href=\"http://trailanimals.com/\"\u003eTARC\u003c/a\u003e running camp all smitten with bug and mosquito bites.

They’re open to anybody who is remotely interested in the outdoors and just let the sheer culture of this community take over the reins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn hindsight, that experience at camp last year deeply impacted my outlook towards running. From barely training for any of the half and full marathons and winging them for the most part, I diligently trained for a 50 miler early this year. The primary intention was to understand my body better and get into a better fitness regimen. Pretty ironic that I ended up spraining my ankle badly during the main event and had to drop out. A run for which I’d logged \u003ca href=\"https://srikanthperinkulam.com/category/channel/training/\"\u003emore than 300 miles\u003c/a\u003e in training! Endurance has always been my forte and however arduous it be, I have never ‘given-up’ during a run/hike over the last ten or so years that I’ve been exploring outdoors. As I was walking back to the car that day, I was in second thoughts if I should have pushed it and completed the run. Something that I didn’t have a definitive answer for then and neither do I have now. All I knew was that my morale did take a beating for sure. Wapack and Back remains an unfinished business and I will have to get back on those rolling peaks to make peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camp this weekend was a much needed fix. Just being there surrounded by folks who have DNF’d before consciously for practical reasons and physical limitations took some load off my shoulders. Overall I believe I also had good quality runs this weekend. I felt much stronger on the trails and my average pace definitely seems to have gone up. I can’t wait to get back to a good training regimen again. I definitely do want to make it to more of the weekly runs at the Fells and should also probably join the Blue Hills group whenever feasible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a more tangible target, I have my eyes on the StoneCat 50 miler this November. The India trip may be a mild deterrent but I think I should be able to find a way around that…\u003c/p\u003e","title":"TARC Camp 2017"},{"content":" Srikanth Perinkulam\nLiked: HOWTO – Setting up the Selfoss Feed Reader with microformats support\nThis post will show how to install the Selfoss feed reader with Aaron Parecki’s additions to support reading weblogs and websites that include support for microformats.

While exploring options, I chanced upon the Indieweb philosopy which seemed to resonate quite a lot with my thoughts. Over the next few weeks I started taking steps to eventually migrate my publishing platform to a more robust framework. Below is a rough outline of what I have in place so far. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep this article live with updates as I work on enhancements.\nCore framework:\nThis website is built with Wordpress and is currently hosted on DigitalOcean [DO] fired-up by ServerPilot. I upgraded to DO early in 2017 from a shared server and I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying the tremendous benefits that comes with it. More on that is here.\nInteraction with Silos:\nWhile I\u0026rsquo;m not quite an online dweller on social networks, I do post once a while on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Over the last few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve syndicated my posts to these networks on and off using various plugins. But none of those had features to fetch the interactions or responses back to my portal. Something that I really \u0026lsquo;craved\u0026rsquo; for. While looking for better alternatives, I chanced upon the concept of webmentions. Meandering through the gamut of options, I eventually found a few tweaks that would work best for my publishing workflow.\nThe first step was to get my wordpress install talk indieweb. The WP starter page and the Advanced WP setup page on the Indieweb wiki were good places to get the wheels rolling and setup a base framework. Since I predominantly publish or draft articles while commuting, I was exploring options to post from a mobile device (iPhone). I lost my trust on the official wordpress app after it lost a couple of my drafts. And then I chanced upon Workflow which looked reliable and seemed to fit all my needs. Outlined below is a rough note on how I interact with the three silos using the workflow app on my iPhone and some custom functions in my WP install.\nThe general idea was to collect, process and publish. Based on the desired action (Post a status or activity update, Bookmark a link, Reply to a post and Publish a photo) I designed workflows to process the information and push it over to the Wordpress action. One minor issue was that the post-kinds plugin sets up and uses a wordpress taxonomy called \u0026lsquo;kind\u0026rsquo; to hand-shake with the micropub server. Since the WP action in Workflow did not accept entries for taxonomies, I had to create a \u0026rsquo;latch\u0026rsquo; to identify the posts that I create via my workflows and map them to the corresponding \u0026lsquo;kind\u0026rsquo; taxonomy. A few trials and I figured I could use a \u0026lsquo;custom field\u0026rsquo; in the workflow app with some custom code in my functions plugin to map this out for me. The other minor tweak was to make my posts microformat compliant for the webmentions to work their magic. To get this working all I had to do was to feed the requisite html corresponding to that specific action into markdown just before passing it to the wordpress action in workflow. Once that was done posting from my phone became a lot more easier (and fun!).\nI chose to rely on a couple of slick plugins to post to the silos. SNAP helps me push notes out to twitter and I use a tag \u0026rsquo;trigger\u0026rsquo; in my workflow to decide which posts I do not want publish on to twitter. I also use some custom code to add webactions to my twitter specific posts. And then followed Chris Aldrich\u0026rsquo;s tweak to collect twitter mentions on a specific page. To handle Instagram, I use the Dsgnwrks Instagram Importer to consume photos (and their reactions). Ownyourgram for some reason wasn\u0026rsquo;t pushing photos to my server.\nIntents and desires:\nWhile the current publishing workflow works like a charm, I do need to do a few more tweaks to make this a more seamless process. Few things to note in no particular order:\n\u0026lsquo;Sync\u0026rsquo; desktop and mobile workflows. Currently I\u0026rsquo;ve different workflows while posting from these platforms. I use the Indieweb Pressthis bookmarklet while on the desktop and the \u0026lsquo;workflow\u0026rsquo; app while posting from my iPhone. Design a platform independent workflow. With workflow\u0026rsquo;s recent acquisition by apple, I\u0026rsquo;m skeptical of the outcome and need to come up with something that\u0026rsquo;s more resilient. Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be dang difficult to spin a quick PWA or tweak some of the nifty tools that folks have already built. Make my PeriRSS feed reader \u0026rsquo;talk\u0026rsquo; to my portal. Basically enhance it with webactions. Talk better with microformats. Publish my code / workflows so others can easily tweak or adapt them for their use. like reply repost\nlike reply repost\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2017/05/04/centralized-publishing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEarly in 2017, I consciously decided to consolidate all my social accounts and use my website as the main \u0026lsquo;vehicle\u0026rsquo; for online interactions.

What was to be a low-key no activity weekend; turned out to be packed with a ton of impromptu events.\nSaturday was probably our most \u0026rsquo;touristic\u0026rsquo; day so far in Boston. Miss Me bought a couple of Groupon passes to the Mapparium some days back. On Friday we realised those were expiring soon and decided to head there this weekend. Two other places - The USS Constitution and the Bunker Hill monument have been on our list for quite sometime now. So Miss Me packaged these all together and chalked out a quick plan early on Saturday morning.\nA brief stop to pick up the USS Constitution museum pass from the local library and off we were to the Mapparium. Housed in the Christian Science Museum, the Mapparium is a 30 foot hollow glass globe with a bridge inside and a map etched to scale in the interiors. Frozen in time (1935), the globe gives you a beautiful perspective of history with its visually striking stained glass and the led light display. An accompanying audio tour and the acoustics in the globe further enhance the experience.Something truly unique I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far.\nFrom there we head out to see the USS Constitution. It\u0026rsquo;s apparently the oldest commissioned ship afloat in the world. The ship and the museum close by reminded us of our visit to Fort McHenry in Baltimore earlier this year.\nAt a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw away is a Korean War Memorial. Remembrance stones and plaques surround a statue of a soldier in rain gear. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible how history is presented so beautifully here.\nWe then head over to the Bunker hill monument close by. This monument\u0026rsquo;s been in an eye shot distance every-time I head to Middlesex Fells for a run, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never really taken a detour to visit it. Looks like it\u0026rsquo;s kept its distance waiting for just the right weather like today\u0026rsquo;s. Dense dark cloud formations, mild drizzle, billowing winds and lowly temperatures. A good 300 steps climb to the top builds enough appetite for a satisfying buffet at a restaurant in Cambridge.\nOnce we\u0026rsquo;re back home, I get ready for my long run which I had procrastinated for the evening. Driving earlier in the day today Miss Me and I scouted another route for me to run. I head toward newton street, then instead of turning right towards south street head straight up beyond Putnam circle onto VFW parkway.\nThen bordering along Allandale woods, I intercept the diamond necklace in Jamaica Pond and then decide to head towards the Yoga studio in Brookline. Legs felt pretty good and weather was cold and crisp with a light drizzle. I decide to go further on and hit the Boston University bridge. Boston looked so pretty tonight from Cambridge!\nRan further upto Harvard and finally decided to turn around. Called Miss Me and asked for a pick up at her Studio. Could have easily gone to 25 miles. Wasn’t quite in the mood to head back on the home stretch. Also wasn’t sufficiently fueled with liquids through the day. So decided to call it a day (night). 16 miles and a climb of 300 steps earlier in the day today at Bunker Hill Monument. One of those really good, fulfilling days!\nWe decide to spruce up the lazy (and sore) saturday morning with a visit to El recreo coffee - a small Nicaraguan shop close-by. Back home, a quick lunch and we decide to fit in a good bike ride. We head out to Arnold Arboretum and are back home by around 5ish. Overall a relaxed day with about 12 miles on the bike.

Having set them up on separate domain spaces, It was getting excruciatingly difficult to update/maintain/upgrade them. The admin interface at times was dead slow and I had restrictions with server permissions which wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite helpful. My first thought was to procure a home server and host all the portals from there. Besides speed and control, It would also give me flexibility to tinker with other self-hosted apps that I\u0026rsquo;ve been itching to work on. It looked like a great solution but I knew it would also need me to invest a lot of time, getting up to speed with server administration. With my new running schedule and several other things, time was a luxury I didn\u0026rsquo;t have and I was soon scouting for alternatives.\nI figured the \u0026lsquo;cloud\u0026rsquo; was a good alternative. While debating between AWS and Azure I came across DigitalOcean [DO] which seemed to be a great testing ground for Cloud services. It seemed to have all that I was looking for and apparently was also pretty easy to setup. Besides, with another service called Serverpilot.io I could spin a portal with just a few clicks. Sometime late in December when one of my shared servers expired, I bit the bullet and signed up with DO. It\u0026rsquo;s been pretty stable and worry-free so far. I see a tremendous improvement in speed, and goes without saying, the flexibility is incredible. As an added bonus, I also got to port to https using LetsEncrypt. Something that I sub-consciously wanted to do for a long time now. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t have asked for more! Over the next few weeks, as other shared accounts expire, I plan to migrate all of my other websites over to DO. It\u0026rsquo;s been a fun ride and a huge learning experience.\nIn the process I also came across a few nifty tools that do incredible things. The All-in-one WP Migration plugin does wonders in migration. All you need to do is install it in your old server setup, download the export and then import that into your brand new wordpress setup. This plugin takes care of EVERYTHING - posts, pages, CPTs, database, media and what not! It takes me just a minute to migrate my whole setup! Amazing! On another front, I\u0026rsquo;ve been itching to find a tool to publish to my site directly from my phone. The wordpress app worked just fine but didn\u0026rsquo;t quite meet all my needs. And then one day, I chanced upon a neat workaround using the workflow app on my iphone. One of those days when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite in the mood for podcasts, I used the 20 minute train commute to build some custom workflows. Soon I could push updates to my site - be it bookmarks, moments, quick notes, replies, running updates etc which seamlessly get posted with just a few clicks. Once these \u0026lsquo;posts\u0026rsquo; enter my website, I use a couple of plugins to add featured images (Quick featured images) and/or auto post to twitter using SNAP. Some thought behind this was also to live the indieweb philosophy.\nEver since I started training for the 50 miler, I seem to have developed a better approach to time-management. During the week I keep note of all the tasks I would like to work on, prioritize them and then only work on the finishing the top three. This way I spend at-most half an hour during the weekend on server admin tasks and weed out the one\u0026rsquo;s with lower priority. This approach leads to having several want-to but unfinished tasks on the list.

The admin interface at times was dead slow and I had restrictions with server permissions which wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite helpful. My first thought was to procure a home server and host all the portals from there. Besides speed and control, It would also give me flexibility to tinker with other self-hosted apps that I\u0026rsquo;ve been itching to work on. It looked like a great solution but I knew it would also need me to invest a lot of time, getting up to speed with server administration.

Psyched!\n[sgpx gpx=\u0026quot;/wp-content/uploads/gpx/01282017_033241.gpx\u0026quot;]\nWith a family event planned for this weekend, I had to fit in my 20mile saturday run early in the day. Given my last weekends pace at Middlesex fells, I wanted to bucket at least 5 hours for the run. Got to bed at around 08:30pm on Friday night, was up by about 03:00am on Saturday and started the run by 03:30am. Mild showers and pretty comfortable temperatures (20-30F) had me going pretty good and I covered the first loop (8 miles) in about 01:40mins. Miss Me was already up and had an Orange shot (Orange juice with some chat masala!) and PBJs ready for me. A quick pit-stop at home and I head back towards Brookline to cover the rest of the miles. I knew the Brookline loop would give me an easy 10 miles, so decided to run further on to Fenway to get the extra 2 miles. Even before I knew, I was on my way back and was home by 07:30am. This was probably my fastest 20 miler so far. Also a great morale boost after my deplorable 17 miles last weekend.\nMiss Me managed to go for a Yoga class while I was running and once she was back, we hit the road to Southborough and then towards NJ. 40mins into the drive, the left rear tire blew up and with that our plans to head to NJ went kaput. We eventually make our way back home by noon. A lazy rest of the day gives me enough rest for the 11 miler next day.\nAll of us head to Callahan State park and as I rake in the miles, the rest of the folks head back home after an hour. I weave into trails I\u0026rsquo;ve been on before and spruce it up with sections that I\u0026rsquo;ve not explored so far. The sheer number of trails out here so close to the city limits blows my mind every single time I chance upon uncharted sections. As I\u0026rsquo;m just about to finish my run in about 2.5 hours, I have a scooping fall. A good one at that. Talk about being \u0026lsquo;down to earth\u0026rsquo;!\nToday is a stark reminder that I\u0026rsquo;m much, much slower on the trails and should be using this pace as benchmark to push and improve. As I build my miles, hopefully the pace improves.

The plan was to get out of home before the break of dawn, head out to one of the umpteen number of forts and villages on the outskirts of the city and spend the rest two days just being out there. The weekends were an interesting mix of some terrific hikes, long bike rides or just days of hopping on and off arbitrary buses with no specific destination.

Looking back those were some of my most memorable days.\nCouple days back during a regular stroll at Larz Anderson, the crisp air really got me thinking. Over the last year - work, exams and several other things have taken up a lot of my mind-space and I realized, I badly needed something else to get me back on my toes. Something to look forward to everyday and to keep me going. This, coupled with my want to enter into a better running regimen got me to consciously commit to running every single day. To start with, the goal is to run at least a mile every day, irrespective of weather, health or anything else the mind tries to concoct and come up with. It\u0026rsquo;s been just a few days since I decided to do this and I already see how hugely rewarding those ten - fifteen minutes being out there in the dark is. In a few weeks, I do want to significantly build up the mileage and hopefully be in a better shape for the TARC DRB next year.\nEventually, I do want to blend in more non-negotiables (reading, chanting, writing and whatever I think I\u0026rsquo;d ideally like to do every single day).

On our way to New Haven, the Jeep started self-accelerating and the brakes didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to work. Luckily there weren\u0026rsquo;t many cars on the road and we were on a slight positive gradient. With whatever little brake power left, I was able to reduce the speed to the sub 50s and tried using the rumble strips on the shoulder to further decelerate. I eventually got the vehicle to come to a rough halt with some gear shifts and a crude ignition stall. Just in time before a merge from the right!\nA couple of calls to AAA and we were soon towed to a nearby Firestone. The garage was already busy with other cars and we were told we had to wait a couple of hours before they could even look at the issue. Soon after lunch, Meena and I were deliberating if we should tow the vehicle all the way back to Boston. With the garage closing at 5, we weren\u0026rsquo;t very optimistic that the folks here would be able to get to and resolve the issue over the next 3 hours. As we mentioned this to Bob, the chief mechanic; he said he was just about to have someone look at the car. We decide to give them a shot. They got the car into the shed and after about half an hour, Bob comes back saying they weren\u0026rsquo;t able to replicate the issue. However, he said they knew what could have possibly caused the mysterious acceleration. He mentioned it was highly likely the floor mat moved up during the drive, crumpled and entrapped the gas pedal leading to unintended acceleration. The brakes thus didn’t seem to work. I was hysterically pleased - both at the simple \u0026lsquo;fix\u0026rsquo; and at the hundreds of dollars we\u0026rsquo;d saved by not towing the vehicle back home. We soon hit the road, and got rid of the floor mat.\nOn the way back home, we hit quite some traffic. It nevertheless gave me some mind space to think. There were quite a few ways the incidents earlier during the day could have transpired. Had there been more traffic on our way to New Haven, we possibly would be dealing with a couple of totaled cars and the ramifications that came with it. Had we rejected Bob\u0026rsquo;s offer, we quite possibly would have towed the car all the way back to Boston. Even better, Bob could have easily said something else was wrong with the car and made a quick buck out of the whole issue. Later on Sunday night, I learnt the ignition stall could possibly be a bad idea since it lets the vehicle essentially lose control. Evidently it worked fine this time around, possibly since I triggered it at around 20mph. And to think of it, a lot more could have gone wrong. The proverbial - \u0026lsquo;Everything happens for a reason\u0026rsquo; is just not true. I believe the human brain does a wonderful job in assigning a reason to the cause and quite conveniently this is always subtly and retrospectively done. In its quest to find reason, it ends up triggering neural connections that emotionally and logically seem reasonable. So when and how do we draw the line while making choices and how do you substantiate the choices you\u0026rsquo;ve made? Or is the whole premise that as a logical and emotional machine you\u0026rsquo;re feeding good and bad data (choices) as a stimulus to train the body to better react to unforeseeable situations in the future?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2016/04/26/the-grand-cherokee/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast Sunday we had a plausible mishap on the road.

Out for just a few minutes and my fingers start freezing. Decide to head back to the Smart and read indoors while outdoors. Family decides to head out to the Prudential tower for a stroll and dine out. End up taking a to-go from Noodle St. Later that night I realise the chills earlier that evening was an indicator of some downtime. Knocked out that night with sore throat and some temps.\nSome quick crib fixing the next day ( To think of it, this is my fourth!) and a relaxed noon. Later in the evening we decide to head to a fund-raiser that one of Miss Me\u0026rsquo;s friends was organizing for the Boston Marathon. Decided to \u0026lsquo;invest\u0026rsquo; in some raffle tickets and end up winning my first ever lottery. 50 mins. of reflexology. Some head bobbing to some Spanish rock. Meet a bunch of interesting folks and with that more events to look forward to.\nOn another note, signed up for a Trail running camp in June. Need to get some miles under the belt before that.

On another note, tweaked some settings to make this site a bit faster. Potentially exploring moving out of pingbacks and into Webmentions. Well, this is a test post to see if that\u0026rsquo;s working!\nWatched an impromptu Malayalam movie - Anarkali. A good watch. An interesting take on life in Lakshwadeep and a tad bit on diving and free-diving. I take that as another hint!\nSetting up the Norbo and fixing a book shelf are two things still pending.

Late yesterday evening as I read James Morgan\u0026rsquo;s article on the sea nomads and another thought provoking article - \u0026lsquo;In search of Whales\u0026rsquo; by Anuar Patjane, it kindled fond memories of the scuba dive Meena and I did in 2012. We didn\u0026rsquo;t quite encounter mammals of that scale, neither did we dive to such depths. But the sheer presence in an environment alien to us and the first hand exposure to the magnanimity and the beauty surrounding us was immeasurably humbling.\nI learned that the ocean gives all — the most beautiful moments full of life and joy, but that it can also take everything away in just a few short seconds, replacing life and beauty with violence and death. - Anuar Patjane\nHow true! Every time I set foot in water I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of an age-old maxim my grandmother used to mention to us as kids, to get our guards on while visiting the beach. The ocean in all its magnanimity lets you fool around twice. The first time you challenge it, it gently wades you back to the shore. The second time you question its power, it proves how minuscule you are, but still gets you back to the shore. The third time you decide to move against it, it absolutely consumes you and makes you a part of itself.\nThis year, it\u0026rsquo;s time to revisit my Scuba certifications and get some interesting dives in.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2016/03/20/deep-waters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA few days back, I posted an early morning shot in Instagram.

The ease of its installation and maintenance, the power of scaling, the flexibility to adapt it to your requirements and it\u0026rsquo;s ever present support framework is something that I\u0026rsquo;ve really grown to appreciate over time.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve worked on several installations of WordPress and over these years extensively tested quite a few plugins. Here\u0026rsquo;s a log of plugins that I\u0026rsquo;ve really found useful and hopefully will update this list as I experiment more with them:\n[fruitful_tabs type=\u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;100%\u0026rdquo; fit=\u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo;]\n[fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Security and Regular Maintenance \u0026ldquo;]\nWordfence Security Started using this plugin when one of my sites was hacked (more on this later) and sworn by it ever since then. With server-side scans, e-mail alerts and regular updates, this is one plugin you should install by default.\nBad Behavior You just need to get hacked once to realize how vulnerable you actually are! I installed this plugin as a primary shield to spammers and malicious code and the ships\u0026rsquo; been sailing in full mast ever since.\nUpdraft Plus A backup and restoration plugin I came across recently that easily backups the core files and databases to S3 buckets (And other services)\nAkismet There\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no reason why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t install this plugin. Its free, works wonders and just so easy to set up. Add a captcha and your site should be rock-solid.\n[/fruitful_tab]\n[fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Speed and SEO\u0026rdquo;]\nW3 Total Cache Though not that straightforward, you can count on this plugin to drastically improve your site\u0026rsquo;s speed and performance. There are tons of reference guides available online and in a few minutes you should be all fired up!\nCloudFlare Install this plugin once you setup a cloudflare account (Free) for your site. Besides the benefits of a CDN you also get another layer of security for DOS attacks.\nWordpress SEO The most powerful SEO plugin I\u0026rsquo;ve come across yet. With a nifty setup it compels you to write better content. The ease of updating your meta tags and the dynamic scoring gives you a very clear picture on your SEO rankings for each post.\nWP-Optimize Worpress being the dynamic CMS gives you robust features such as post revisions, Trackbacks and pingbacks, transient options to state a few. Over time as your portal content increases, this may cause unnecessary meta data and content. WP-optimize does a wonderful job of optimizing and cleaning your database.\nBroken link checker One nifty plugin to keep track of your links. Based on your site settings, this plugin gives you complete control of the links you use on your portal and does a brilliant job not only in picking up broken links but also giving you remedial options.\n[/fruitful_tab]\n[fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Custom Post Types\u0026rdquo;]\nPods - Custom Content Types and Fields Enter the world of Custom content types and fields - The true power of Wordpress as a CMS. Pods helps you generate CPTs in a matter of seconds. I chanced on this plugin when I just learnt about CPTs and have been extensively using them ever since.\nBook Review Library Think of this as a variant of the Pods plugin. This plugin comes in-built with features such as authors and ratings.\nCurrent Menu Item for Custom Post Types This plugin lets you add a parent page for a CPT and highlight the menu accordingly.\n[/fruitful_tab]\n[fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Enhanced features\u0026rdquo;]\nTablePress WordPress by default doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide tables. This plugin gives you a truly functional and easy to implement table feature for your installation. With import and export features, this is one plugin that really stands out in its kind.\nByTheWay Annotations If you\u0026rsquo;ve read any of my Actuarial Postpad posts, you would have noticed the power of [btw] ByTheWaty Annotations [/btw]! One effective short-code usage to highlight content.\nCustom Sidebars Powered by the super-awesome wpmudev team, this is one plugin you could use to modify the way you display content even in really complex themes. The flexibility to work on the sidebars is truly amazing!\nDisplay posts shortcode This plugin gives you the power to display list of posts based on certain criteria. The truly powerful feature is its ability to work with Custom Post Types. Well documented and one truly powerful plugin.\nJetpack Powered by Automattic, this plugin gives you a slew of features to customize your Wordpress installation. Most of the settings work out of the box and brings in features previously only available to Wordpress.com users.\nSimple Mathjax One powerful plugin to solve all your latex worries on Wordpress. Most of my mathematical posts are powered by Simple Mathjax and Jetpacks inbuilt latex support. CodeCogs LATEX equation editor is yet another support framework truly worth exploring!\nSyntaxHighlighter Evolved This plugin easily helps you post your syntax highlighted code in your posts. With its support for many languages and its ease of use, this plugin is a must have if you work with developing and sharing code snippets.\nWP CSV One simple CSV export and import plugin. Works with CPTs too.\nBetter Font Awesome Helps you automatically integrate the latest version of the font awesome toolkit into your Wordpress installation.\n[/fruitful_tab]\n[fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Storage and Media\u0026rdquo;]\nAmazon Webservices I recently moved all my images to the Amazon S3 service to steer clear of image link issues and server delays. The Amazon Webservices plugin is a primary plugin to connect your Wordpress installation to Amazons\u0026rsquo; Webservices account.\nAmazon S3 and CloudFront Coupled with the Amazon Webservices plugin, this plugin automatically uploads all your images on to the S3 bucket you\u0026rsquo;d setup previously. The optional CloudFront feature also brings in the additional benefit of serving your images from Amazons\u0026rsquo; CDN.\nRegenerate Thumbnails A handy plugin to regenerate all your thumbnails. Very useful when you have images that are not yet ported on to the Amazon S3 bucket but would like to do so in bulk. More of a secondary option but truly worth it!\nInstagrate to wordpress Sync your Instagram posts with Wordpress and use the auto post to seamlessly post updates to your portal.\n[/fruitful_tab]\n[fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Charts and Mapping\u0026rdquo;]\nWP-GPX-Maps When talking about fitness, data and Wordpress , this is one plugin I would highly recommend. Using imported GPX files, this plugin gives you dynamic elevation, speed, cadence and heart-rate plots. Brilliance at work!\ngpx2chart Yet another nifty plugin that captures your Garmin data beautifully with core statistics tabled out. Talk about details!\n[/fruitful_tab]\n[/fruitful_tabs]\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2015/04/08/important-plugins-for-your-wp-installation/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOver the last seven years, since I \u003ca href=\"https://srikanthperinkulam.com/site-hosting/transition-from-v1-0-to-v2-0\" title=\"Transition from v1.0 to v2.0\"\u003emoved to a self hosted platform\u003c/a\u003e I\u0026rsquo;ve grown really fond of WordPress as a CMS.

Meena and I were driving around in Chennai finishing up some printing errands when we have this discussion on students, schools and graduate programs. We were trying to figure out tier A, B and C schools for a student whom her dad was counselling and midst that discussion, I happen to mention I should apply to schools just for the heck of it. The moment freezes and she gives me the typical \u0026lsquo;Meena-look\u0026rsquo; and says - \u0026lsquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s do it!\u0026rsquo;.\nWe drive back home and speak to her Mom and Dad to pick their brains. Both are thrilled - to say the least. I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to complete a Master\u0026rsquo;s but for a long time wasn\u0026rsquo;t really sure which specialization to major in. We deliberate on how Actuarial Science is such a wonderful fit for me and why now is a good time. For the last few months we\u0026rsquo;ve been in a flux with Meena\u0026rsquo;s grad school admit, the immigrant visa situation and a slew of other things. This would only add further complications or rather - \u0026ldquo;Happy Problems\u0026rdquo; as the Bhaskars put it (and something I\u0026rsquo;ve come to really appreciate now).\nThat very day, we sit down to look-up universities and admission deadlines and even before I knew I\u0026rsquo;d applied to five schools - all in a span of 2-3 days. Days roll by and late February 2013 as I sit staring at coconut trees in my maternal grand-mothers house in Trivandrum the admit from Columbia creeps in. As I call and inform Meena and her parents of the admit offer, they\u0026rsquo;re electrified! I knew Columbia was a good school, really liked their electives but honestly didn\u0026rsquo;t really know that this was a great deal. I\u0026rsquo;d received an offer from another good university a few days back but chose to go ahead with Columbia for its obvious network benefits and city-location.\nSummer 2013, I eventually start the program and from then on - it\u0026rsquo;s been a great mix of experiences and surprises. Getting back into student-shoes after six long years has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Mottled with assignments, classes, internships, examinations, deadlines, projects, presentations and seminars - The last year and a half has been a great fire-up! Having the opportunity to meet some incredible people and take classes with some really great professors by itself was a huge learning.\nAll that said, to me personally If my $100,000 education was any worth it, it was because of a statement that one of the professors\u0026rsquo; I really look up to kept mentioning -\n\u0026ldquo;If there\u0026rsquo;s one thing I\u0026rsquo;d like you all to take from my class it\u0026rsquo;s this - It takes years and years to earn reputation of integrity, but just a second to lose it.\u0026rdquo;\nThis sounds cliché - but just to hear it from somebody who you consider a role model, mention it every semester class; totally drives home the point. And for that I\u0026rsquo;m truly thankful to everybody - family and friends who\u0026rsquo;ve been instrumental in getting me here to where I am now.\nWith the Masters\u0026rsquo; taken care of, the next short-term career goal is to earn my fellowship credentials in the next few years. It\u0026rsquo;s a steep up-curve but I\u0026rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the ride and am more than thrilled to have chosen this path. Exciting times ahead!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2015/03/07/its-official/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt all winds back to a random October afternoon in 2012.

Working towards better utilizing our weekends and trying to visit the lesser known areas of New York; Meena found a great deal for a four hour cruise on Groupon. We were supposed to reach Riis Landing in Queens by 02:30pm. A snow storm was predicted later in the day and we weren\u0026rsquo;t quite sure if the cruise would happen. However with no change in plans reported from the organizers, we left home for the 1.5hr commute to Riis.\nBut for a couple of missed connections, we were well in time for the cruise. On the way and just before we left Riss landing, we happened to meet quite a few interesting folks from Mercy\u0026rsquo;s college. Only later would we know that this particular cruise was possible because this online cohort of the teachers college was meeting for an assignment to study the water quality and the American Princess, the team that organizes these tours in the Atlantic was facilitating their work.\nThe weather is pretty good with a faint hint of a looming snow shower and a teasing wind. We leave just about in time from Riss Landing and Paul - the lead naturalist on the American Princess clearly explains the possible sightings we may have for the day. In about half an hour we reach Swinburne Island and the American Princess comes to a standstill just about 30ft from the man made island. Right by the edge of the island we see a colony of seals bobbing around. Possibly sensing human presence around, they dive into the waters and swim at a safe distance. It truly was a mesmerizing sight to watch such a huge colony right in New York\u0026rsquo;s backyard. After a good 3o minute halt the captain navigates closer to breezy point and we have a decent sighting of a snowy owl perching on the dunes.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a short video of the seals:\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-rk5FDUlOQ\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be``]\nWhile the American Princess, gets us back to shore I grab a quick moment with Paul to discuss his work. Paul has been a curator in the New York and New England aquariums for the past 40 years. Though currently retired, his latest project is to record and keep track of the seals, dolphins and whales in NY waters with the help of the Maritime center at Kingsborough community college. It\u0026rsquo;s probably a bit too early to distinctly say this, however preliminary data that the team\u0026rsquo;s collected so far indicates that seals have been increasingly migrating to the Swinburne Island over the last few years. As with every other project, financial constraints regulate the number of trips his team can make to the Island and it is only with commercial partnerships such as the current one with American Princess, it is possible for them to truly pursue their tasks. It was an absolute honour to meet someone just so involved in what he truly cherishes doing and it is chance encounters such as this, I believe is what truly defines our experiences and I eagerly look forward to being more engaged with the work they\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nIf you happen to be around here in the city, Irrespective of whether you find a connect with seals or marine life; this is one tour you should definitely make. Lookout for those Groupons or just reach out to Paul!\nOn another note, We found this idol by the banks.

It started with that defining moment when I heard her shout across the hallway to another colleague about a bike ride. At the end of two years, she not only convinced me to tie the knot right after the fellowship but also join her dad\u0026rsquo;s freshly relaunched company. A wonderful wedding led us down south to Chennai. Right after the wedding, Meena[Me] had plans to head to UCAL, Berkeley for her masters. She\u0026rsquo;d petitioned for my visa to the US and then I had absolutely no idea what I\u0026rsquo;d be doing here besides running a few marathons. Just a couple of days before she flew out, the university got back to her stating she couldn\u0026rsquo;t join that term as she didn\u0026rsquo;t have the mandatory 16 years of education. Me joined me in helping her dad at the SOHO where we tutored and counselled students for GRE and GMAT. This was besides elaborate meetings with several people and universities on niche courses we could bring to the table.

On a random drive back home, I remember discussing with Me on our plans in general and that\u0026rsquo;s when it struck us as to why not I apply to a couple of schools just as a backup option. Me\u0026rsquo;s dad had always felt I was a brilliant fit for an Actuarial Career. Since I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to pursue a masters I planned to do it in something that would really connect the dots. Amidst all the domestic travel we got the applications out in about a week. After a couple of weeks, Columbia got back with an admit offer and I happily accepted. We moved to the US late in march. It\u0026rsquo;s been about two months now and I\u0026rsquo;m just about two weeks into my masters.

We had a day of theory, a day of sessions in the swimming pool and two days in the ocean.\nOn Friday night, Me \u0026amp; Sri boarded a bus from Chennai to Pondicherry. We found a room close to the bus station and retired early, excited about diving in the ocean the next morning. At about 6:30 we arrived at the dive center and started putting our equipment together for the dive that day. We loaded the tanks and all the equipment into the cars and drove to the water. After about an hour on the boat, we reached our dive site about 10 km from the shore. We geared up for our first dive and dove in with Arvind Anna as our instructor. Right when we were about to dive in, we discovered that Sri had seasickness. Soon after we discovered that jumping into the water made it all better. It really was a surreal feeling breathing under water and I wondered what would happen if I breathed in by mistake. We slowly inched our way down along the rope. The water somehow seemed to envelope us and the fish swam around as if we didn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nInitially it was very dark and murky but as we went further down, the water became clearer. As we inched downwards, we hit a band of colder water that gave us goosebumps and made our teeth chatter. Once we moved past that patch, the water warmed up again and the visibility drastically improved. We saw numerous small silver fish swimming around. Between these fish were other fish, different kinds that we had never seen before. So many different colors, shapes and sizes. After almost 40 minutes under the water, we came up to the surface. It was an amazing experience to be under water and the time had gone by so fast we didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that we had been underwater for that long until Arvind Anna showed us his watch.\nAfter the dive, we were ravenous. We wolfed down some chips, biscuits, pretty much anything we could get our hands down and waited eagerly for our next dive. We had a great second dive, this time going a little deeper and practicing more safety and survival skills. We resurfaced after a little more than half an hour under water.\nWe got back to the shore, loaded the cars and drove back to the dive center. Tired, we went back to the hotel room and after a good shower and driving around Pondicherry a little, we had a relaxed dinner and retired for the night. We didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how tired we were until we lay down to sleep and were instantly knocked out.\nWe dragged ourselves out of bed the next morning, still weary from the day before. Part of us wanted to stay in the hotel room and go back to sleep while the other half wanted to go diving again. We checked out of the hotel and got ourselves to the dive center. We packed our equipment, loaded it in the cars and headed to the shore. We got into the boat and started heading to the dive site. A few kms in, there was a problem with the boat and we couldn\u0026rsquo;t go any further. After trying to hail other boats to help us for about half an hour, one of the fishing boats came and dragged us back to the shore. Another boat was arranged and we transferred all the equipment onto the other boat, jumped in and were off to the dive site again. We were running an hour late but were still pumped up about the upcoming dives.\nWe got to the dive site and geared up for the dives. We had some different safety skills lined up for practice and dove straight in. We had two amazing dives, this time going right to the bottom of the ocean, which was about 30 meters in. While working on our buoyancy control, Sri shot straight through the water to the surface and Arvind Anna and I followed him up. When we got to the surface, we figured he hadn\u0026rsquo;t quite mastered the art of keeping himself buoyant and we dove back down into the water. Altogether we spent about an hour and a half underwater that day. Tired and hungry we came back to the shore, loaded the bags into the cars and went back to the dive center. We completed our log books and were ready to leave. We grabbed some food from a bakery close by and hurried back to Chennai with Arvind Anna as we were booked to leave for Pune that same night for a very special friend, Chikita\u0026rsquo;s wedding.\nHungry and weary we got back home, packed in a jiffy and headed to the station to catch our train.\nMe \u0026amp; Sri look forward to their next diving adventure, hopefully sooner rather than later and want to tell the whole world about what an awesome experience it was. We especially recommend the dive center at Pondicherry as Arvind Anna is the most amazing instructor and is a pro diver himself.\nHere are the details of the dive center at Pondicherry. We highly recommend that you go for a dive and definitely worth it in Pondicherry.

So be it.\nFour months later, soon after I headed back to Hyderabad over just another lousy week; I happened to read a mail from the AdVentura team. It was about a Parasailing event that was being organized in Hoskote. Impulsively, I gave Suma a call and got myself registered. Given the short time span, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t arrange for tickets to Bangalore. As a last resort I went down to the Bus terminus and by sheer luck managed to get a ticket in the APSRTC inter-state transport bus. That weekend changed my perspective towards life. Up there in the air about 450m high, I decided I\u0026rsquo;d live like I\u0026rsquo;ve never lived before. Back on the ground, I promised Suma that I’d help her start a club in Hyderabad. Finally on 6th Feb 2008, Hyderabad had its own Adventure club - HydVentura.\nOn 27th March 2007, when I was transferred to Pune. I was on cloud nine. Pune as I knew it then, was a magnificient, young city. Little did I know what was in store for me . Just a week there and I managed to be an integral part of Deccan Highlander - The unofficial Infy Pune Trekking club. Almost every other weekend we\u0026rsquo;ve been on treks. The count never mattered. The count could be four, or it could be forty. All that mattered was we stood to the promise of having at least one trek per week.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2012/05/16/hiking/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt all started when I realized, I was not a normal human .

This nomination would enable the champion to compete in the final rung for a scholarship that would partially waive his/her next years academic fees.\nParticipation and Performance certificates EVENTS:\nDrills Speed Workouts Kabaddi Amoeba race Relay race Obstacle crossing The rationale behind El Campeonato:\nMarch is generally a testing time for teachers and students. With end of year examinations round the corner and in an academic setup during times such as this, it would be surprising to find the staff room void of any discussions around the projected \u0026lsquo;pass rate\u0026rsquo; of the students. Besides, with the direct and indirect interactions with a networked group of teachers that we have here, most of the discussions are about the end of year examinations.That is where Kavitha and I found the disconnect. We just couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out why the last few weeks before the examination had to be so stressful on the kids and their parents. Revision in the last moment just before the examinations and the data emanating from this process system wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really give a gauge of the students academic capabilities. More so the data from these examinations just remain figures in paper or data projections that grossly are invalid given the scope of these so called examinations. We for one didn\u0026rsquo;t want the kids to pass through a cycle of unnecessary strain period - something that we were compelled to go through during our \u0026rsquo;education\u0026rsquo; phase.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s this theory that is highly talked about in the circles here that academic achievement is what motivates kids to excel in other learning streams - yet another school of thought that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t digest. Through the second year, we focused our instructions more towards constructive learning than just based on formative or summative data analysis. Eventually the time that the kids spent outdoors became almost equal to the time they spent indoors. Probably that is what led us to formulating this championship - El Campeonato. This by no means is the \u0026lsquo;mandated\u0026rsquo; showcase. It\u0026rsquo;s just a platform for us as teachers to explore what holistic learning could mean, a platform for the kids to participate in the essence of team work and patience; not to compete just to win but to also learn by losing. As the baton passes, only time would tell what will last\u0026hellip;\nEvent details:\nBe there at our school premises at 0800hrs sharp on the 17th of March to see our dragons, unicorns and the Pegasus compete to win the Gladiators trophy.\nBring your own drinks and snacks to beat the march sun, for its going to be one long exciting day with lots of fun.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2012/03/12/el-campeonato-march-17th-0800hrs-mystic-land-of-epiphany/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome things are just worth fighting for.

I took a quick shower and decided to take a stroll. Left at about 1749 and decided to walk down to the Shangumugam beach about 6kms from my house. In a sturdy pace I hit the beach and returned back on a different route. Thought process all through the walk was nothing intellectual. Just random strings buzzing in and out. Got back home and hit the bed pretty early.\nWhat happened post this is something that really got me thinking. I saw this amazing dream of me strategically and miraculously surviving from a historic fort that was giving in to torrential waters from an ancient collapsing dam. Looks like we[Not really sure \u0026lsquo;Who\u0026rsquo;] were walking across this really huge dam. The water is quite transparent and is sparkling blue. All of a sudden we sense the water level going up. People start running helter skelter and there\u0026rsquo;s a mad rush to get across to the safer contours. Funnily there\u0026rsquo;s also a set of people who\u0026rsquo;re lazily walking around. Then there\u0026rsquo;s an immaculate focus on a few people trying to help others cross. and even before we know most of us are in the water. A few know how to swim, rest are left dangling underwater on to crevices on the stone formations. [The water is pristine blue and transparent.] Somehow the whole setup changes and is now of a historic fort and water gushing into the minarets and tombs. As I\u0026rsquo;m lost in the waters, I see the gates of the dam opening up. I turn around. My mind still knowing this to be a dream tries to understand the logic. It senses that one of the gates pulls in horizontally towards the left thus creating a huge space for the water to fill in; leading to the water level subsiding in the reservoir. Finally it so happens that most of us are safely stranded on the ruins. People run around to find their dear ones. Atharv and Pranav - two of my kids finally find their mother who for some reason talks about people spitting in the corners and smoking up. A kid comes and thanks me for flinging her away to safety from the moving flood gates. There\u0026rsquo;s suddenly a big crowd moving towards us. Happens to be a politician coming to address the crowd. A few of us take offence and start throwing him and his followers in the water. The itouch morning alarm rings and I\u0026rsquo;m up. All fresh. All happy. All excited.\nThis has been the most colorful, action filled, thought provoking and reflective dream that I\u0026rsquo;ve dream\u0026rsquo;t till date. Not just because of what the brain visualized during the dream but more because of the effect it had on me and my mood the morning that followed. Today I seem to be in my top spirits and I\u0026rsquo;ve finished almost half of what I planned to finish today. This got me to wonder, If a dream really motivates one to be more productive and rejuvenates, can we program our brain to subconsciously create interesting stories and play it when the body is taking rest? Do dreams really mean something? Do they really connect the dots that haven\u0026rsquo;t been joined in reality?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always thought dreams are a manifestation of what your body really wants to see or do. The brain sub-consciously feeds in actions or words from your conversations and visual memory and twines a story as days progress. At one point of time when it gets the trigger - not sure what, it releases the story for you to explore. Probably my trigger was the sound of the thundering waves at the Shangumugam beach clubbed with the stress that the body underwent because of the 13km walk. Well, that seems to be a good start to analyzing the triggers behind dreams!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2011/11/03/a-new-trigger-to-productivity/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYesterday I felt miserably lost and figured I wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing anything worthwhile staring at the screen.

Time and timing is excruciatingly important and you need to be on your heels and watch out for competition. Integrity is vital and discipline makes or breaks your business. This short video encapsulates this doctrine in action.

So it is with Transitional Leadership. Performance under pressure is something that\u0026rsquo;s really important and you need to be on the top of things despite the constraints and limitations. The rulers figured out that deadlines are always round the corner and when you\u0026rsquo;re a top performer pressure is inevitable.

As I went through the list reading each of the kids names, images of the kid kept flashing in and out of my mind and most of them, so turned out to be of those moments when they were being ecstatic or really happy. This made me wonder how we as humans tend to capture/remember only the positives or the cheerful part in our relationships. But as a teacher, am I not failing my kids in not noticing their negative behaviour and working to get them back to their normal self? Am I doing justice to them by not stopping what I’m doing and not taking that extra time to pay attention to that minuscule behavioral change? How many times have I swept a behavioral change under the blanket and continued with my class/session? How many times have I ‘neglected’ a kid in the rush to finish off a topic/objective?\nSadly in retrospect I seem to recollect more than one occasions where I’ve failed noticing/paying heed to the change. This could probably be one of those reasons why a particular kid did not perform well in a particular objective; a reason why a particular kid did not receive me with the same enthusiasm as he otherwise would have and this is something I’m really beginning to appreciate in this role as a teacher. Every moment in the classroom you end up dealing with the emotions of 46 kids out there. Human to human interaction is the utmost priority. When I go back to my classroom in twenty days for the second term, this is one thing that I have to keep in mind always.\nTalking by numbers, my kids have progressed from a class average of 25% to 56% in Math, from 17% to 59% in Grammar and from 28%[-0.1 Grade] to 85%[1.5 Grade] in RC. Thats some significant progress that the class has made. But again, the class average does not necessarily represent the overall growth of the classroom. There still are kids like – Sarfaraz, Nabil, Aditya More, Meghana and Yash Pawar who need to make tremendous progress if they have to be on par with the other kids. I guess that is where the main challenge lies.\nToday, I visualize my classroom as a circular board resting on a pivot. I being the pivot and the circular board, a playground where my 46 little ones decide the dynamics of the classroom from inside. My responsibility is to maintain the equilibrium and I need to be extremely flexible so as to adjust and re-position to the external stimuli and the dynamics created by my kids so that the whole system remains in equilibrium always. The next fortnight I guess is all about figuring out how to maintain that equilibrium, about how I push myself to my limits of being flexible and making that transformation something sustainable…\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2011/07/10/dynamics-of-the-playground/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCouple of  hours back I opened my student tracker,  just sat back and started mulling over how each of my kids have changed over the past few months.

Collectively they seem to know how to reach to the solution but when asked individually they just put up a poker face. English for them seems to be a magnanimous monster lurching right round the corner. I’m yet to figure out where that small invisible spark exists so that I can magically tap it on and fire them up to speed.

It was all one peaceful ambiance with just minor disruptions here and there. To help manage the affairs, the architect of the land decided to pull up a few responsible men and women and give them the authority to administer sections of the land..Well, ‘Decentralization of power’ as they call it. And then, things changed. With just one word, rose eleven kingdoms all powerful and energetic. And within minutes, the Kings and Queens swore at the altar to uprise their just formed kingdoms. Ministers, Treasurers and Soldiers were deputed and responsibilities bestowed.\nEver since then, things have drastically improved. The men and women now have something really concrete to look forward to – a structure, a pattern and above all rejoice in the powers that they otherwise would not have. There’s now an aura of peace in the empire and the subjects seem to be showing quite some interest in strengthening their kingdoms. As days progress, the architect is still working out the finer details as to how the empires could be allowed to rule in mutual peace and still compete with each other for mutual benefit.\nWelcome to Class of IIA at Epiphany- Where we play the Age of Empires with real Kings, Queens and Ministers!\nLooking back, it’s kind of funny how just a random idea seems to be making so much of an impact on the kids. Ever since we divided the classroom into groups and gave them this theme to build upon, things have quite changed. Behavior management in the classroom has tremendously improved and almost every objective that is taught, once related to the theme even in some abstract form is investing the kids so much. It has also given scope to introduce an awesome value system in the class, which I’ve been trying in vain for the past 8 months to integrate in my regular classes. This coming friday, if things work well, I hopefully would be able to introduce them to the barter system and eventually trade and commerce. The options seem endless…\nWhile biking back home today, I wonder why this idea didn’t strike me when I was scouting for a proper theme for my class late June, last year. There’s just about 25 instructional days left for this academic year to come to an end and I probably could have invested them a bit more had things ‘clicked’ before. But well, I guess thats just the feeling of not doing enough, that every teacher experiences every single day in his/her life. Really hoping this new system evolves into a robust framework and also if nothing works, I still can now be proud of founding eleven dynasties, not just in my dreams but in reality!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2011/07/10/when-a-dynasty-is-born.../","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYet another day was coming to an end and the people of the land were tending their chores.

Couple of friends and I had been to the Korlai fort and were heading back from Alibag late in the evening. Seated in the rear of the bus, I’m not really sure how this conversation/debate ensued. For about an hour or so the six of us had a heated conversation on various policies, practices, ideologies and biases. Probably one of the best ever deliberations since my Infy days. In introspection, it kind of gave me some food for thought on how I’d like to proceed with the rest of my fellowship or for the next two years. Since I last wrote, things have quite changed in my classroom and otherwise. TFI has this concept of having two teachers in one class room if the number of students is more than 30. Kavitha, My co-teacher formally chipped in in July. With this things slowly seem to come under control. The kids receive more personal attention and we’re able to address issues in a much better fashion. Couple of kids who never even open their mouths are slowly opening up and and are showing interest in the classroom. The class dynamics has changed and kids are slowly learning to appreciate English. Community visits seem to make an impact.\nGoing by last weeks assessments the class per se has shown significant improvement. But looking holistically I still do not see myself doing justice to the kids. Two years down the lane when I move out of this role, I would like to see my kids be able to speak for themselves, have the confidence to stand for what they really feel about and be able to take appropriate decisions given a set of choices. I personally believe, all that these nimble minds needs is exposure to the world out there and a pathway that would help them generate a practical solution to problems.

Ever since we divided the classroom into groups and gave them this theme to build upon, things have quite changed. Behavior management in the classroom has tremendously improved and almost every objective that is taught, once related to the theme even in some abstract form is investing the kids so much. It has also given scope to introduce an awesome value system in the class, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying in vain for the past 8 months to integrate in my regular classes. This coming friday, if things work well, I hopefully would be able to introduce them to the barter system and eventually trade and commerce. The options seem endless\u0026hellip;\nWhile biking back home today, I wonder why this idea didn\u0026rsquo;t strike me when I was scouting for a proper theme for my class late June, last year. There\u0026rsquo;s just about 25 instructional days left for this academic year to come to an end and I probably could have invested them a bit more had things \u0026lsquo;clicked\u0026rsquo; before. But well, I guess thats just the feeling of not doing enough, that every teacher experiences every single day in his/her life.

Looking back, the major checkpoints[not necessarily listed in order] this year would be:\nRan the infamous Auroville half marathon and vowed never to stop running! Resigned from Infosys to join TeachforIndia. [leaving an awesome team behind and making one profound shift in my career.] Met Paruammai, attended a close friends wedding and more importantly explored Kerala like never before. Joined TFI and reveled in the five week long induction programme. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the temptation to do the Katraj-Sinhagad night trek [Twice on successive weekends!] amidst the rigour of he institute. Missed spending quality time with family! Reported to Epiphany School where I\u0026rsquo;ve been teaching IInd grade kids for the past six months and probably continue to do so for the next 1.5yrs. Paid obeisance to the rain god by trekking the Kenjalgad fort [First monsoon trek by DH.] Hiked up to the Ahupe village to take some time out and celebrate yet another important milestone. Visited the Khadakwasla dam.[Failed executing the rock band idea though!] Revisited[Hiked] Koraigad, Rajmachi and Ratangad. Rode to Khadakwasla dam [Got back to the byke after a long break of 5 months!] Registered for the MBL course by Distance education mode from NLSIU. Visited the Korlai fort [Didn\u0026rsquo;t byke this time!] Registered for the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon[My first Full Marathon!] and raised about 9500Rs. for TFI. Ran the Pune Half marathon.[ Well, actually ran a 25!] Turned 25 Years! Woohoo! Ran the Goa River Marathon. Witnessed Shreks\u0026rsquo; [a co-fellow] wedding in Vizag. Was gifted a Hookah, a mobile speaker , some invaluable coupons and a heart rate monitor! Realised that I could afford to save more than I thought I could. Squared in and took some real important decisions. Vowed to stick on to Ubuntu TOTALLY. Well that kind of summarizes the year that\u0026rsquo;s been till date. Tomorrow hopefully I would run a sweet 30k to siphon off 2010 and usher in 2011 and for some reason, I have this gut feeling that the next year would be even more eventful than this year.\nWishing you [And myself!] an awesome and happening year ahead\u0026hellip;.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/12/30/looking-back-at-2010.../","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOver the past few months, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot thats been happening; but for some reason I just didn\u0026rsquo;t take the time out to visit this space.

As I went through the list reading each of the kids names, images of the kid kept flashing in and out of my mind and most of them, so turned out to be of those moments when they were being ecstatic or really happy. This made me wonder how we as humans tend to capture/remember only the positives or the cheerful part in our relationships. But as a teacher, am I not failing my kids in not noticing their negative behaviour and working to get them back to their normal self? Am I doing justice to them by not stopping what I\u0026rsquo;m doing and not taking that extra time to pay attention to that minuscule behavioral change? How many times have I swept a behavioral change under the blanket and continued with my class/session? How many times have I \u0026rsquo;neglected\u0026rsquo; a kid in the rush to finish off a topic/objective?\nSadly in retrospect I seem to recollect more than one occasions where I\u0026rsquo;ve failed noticing/paying heed to the change. This could probably be one of those reasons why a particular kid did not perform well in a particular objective; a reason why a particular kid did not receive me with the same enthusiasm as he otherwise would have and this is something I\u0026rsquo;m really beginning to appreciate in this role as a teacher. Every moment in the classroom you end up dealing with the emotions of 46 kids out there. Human to human interaction is the utmost priority. When I go back to my classroom in twenty days for the second term, this is one thing that I have to keep in mind always.\nTalking by numbers, my kids have progressed from a class average of 25% to 56% in Math, from 17% to 59% in Grammer and from 28%[-0.1 Grade] to 85%[1.5 Grade] in RC. Thats some significant progress that the class has made. But again, the class average does not necessarily represent the overall growth of the classroom. There still are kids like - Sarfaraz, Nabil, Aditya More, Meghana and Yash Pawar who need to make tremendous progress if they have to be on par with the other kids. I guess that is where the main challenge lies.\nToday, I visualize my classroom as a circular board resting on a pivot. I being the pivot and the circular board, a playground where my 46 little ones decide the dynamics of the classroom from inside. My responsibility is to maintain the equilibrium and I need to be extremely flexible so as to adjust and re-position to the external stimuli and the dynamics created by my kids so that the whole system remains in equilibrium always. The next fortnight I guess is all about figuring out how to maintain that equilibrium, about how I push myself to my limits of being flexible and making that transformation something sustainable\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/11/01/dynamics-of-the-playground.../","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCouple of  hours back I opened my student tracker,  just sat back and started mulling over how each of my kids have changed over the past few months.

And then it looms on me again how important it is to appreciate minuscule milestones in this journey - Something which I\u0026rsquo;ve been working hard on ever since the summer school.\nToday for some reason, I\u0026rsquo;m not really as happy as I should have been. Administered a diagnostic test today and a perfunctory look at the sheets sunk me deeper in the gravel. These kids are just not able to answer even bare simple questions. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent about 23 whole days with these 46 kids and things do not really seem to be on the green side. Classroom and Behavior management still seems to be an issue and objectives wise I haven\u0026rsquo;t progressed much. They seem to understand Math concepts but for some reason that is just not translating onto the answer sheets. Collectively they seem to know how to reach to the solution but when asked individually they just put up a poker face. English for them seems to be a magnanimous monster lurching right round the corner. I\u0026rsquo;m yet to figure out where that small invisible spark exists so that I can magically tap it on and fire them up to speed. A couple of strategies to be implemented and a lot more are to be learnt.\nTomorrow marks a new beginning of looking back and taking the best of what worked; of paying attention and appreciating the minute ‘eureka’ moments in the classroom and not to forget - of understanding how close I could get to build the bridge between possibility, predictability and uncertainty.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/07/08/reflections-by-the-roadside.../","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs I take one last gulp of hot tea from a roadside stall, Ronnie wickedly smiles and brings his hand forward with a congratulatory gesture.

There\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot that\u0026rsquo;s been weaving around here. I initially had planned to document most that’s been happening right from the first day but failed miserably. The ‘induction’ wave just swept me off the coast and kept me in the waters for close to a month. The rigorous schedule during the institute and other things took priority and I just couldn’t fit in time to sit back and write what’s been brewing out here. Things slowly seem to have fallen in place now and I’ve decided to be a bit more regular on my site.\nFor the next two years I would be a class teacher for about 45 second grade kids at the Epiphany school at Guruwarpet, Pune primarily focusing on their English and Math. Going by my preliminary analysis – None of my kids can speak even a basic English sentence properly, Most write in incorrigible handwriting, 2 have been passed on to the second grade despite failing in the first, Just 8 of them understand my English class instructions, Only 4 can differentiate a question from an answer, Average reading fluency stands at about 15wpm [Expected – 40wpm], 3 always retort in Hindi/Marathi when asked a question, Only 6 can add single digit numbers having carryover, 5 cannot even decipher numbers written on the board, 4 just do not want to attend school and 1 girl has this superfluous crush on me! A diagnostic test due later this week would actually bring about how many grade levels my kids are actually lagging behind.\nCouple of months back when similar statistics was put up in a presentation, I just couldn’t buy it. But today when I look at it manifesting in my own classroom, I’m sheerly overwhelmed. Each of my actions in the next two years would in ways impact how these kids perceive things and how their lives transform. In the next two years, one of our main objectives would be to plan and execute each of our lessons such that each one of these kids gets on par with their peers and stand to compete with other ‘advantaged’ kids from the private schools. Things are getting interesting by the day!\nLooking back, joining TFI is probably the best ever decision I’ve taken till date. The commitment and zeal with which people work here, truly amazes me. It just doesn’t feel like working in a non-profit organization. The meticulous planning, professional conduct, transparent execution, the numerous sessions, reflection and de-briefs that keep everyone on their toes day through night simply floors me.\nOne month in the institute starkly redefined what working hard/smart meant. My regular day used to start at about five in the morning with a half an hour run around the I2IT campus and then a dash for the morning breakfast. At about 06:45am buses would transport the 100 odd first institute fellows from the I2IT campus to the summer schools at Somwarpet. At about 12:00pm once the summer school gets over we’d be taken back to the I2IT campus for various institute sessions and debriefs till 20:00hrs. Rest of the day is spent on lesson planning for next days classes or other activities that may go on till 21:00 or 22:00hrs. At the end of the day, you’re literally exhausted. There used to be so much to learn and do, at times I just did not understand what was happening around me. There were times when I’d question the very logic of lesson planning and the innumerable sessions. But over time as we saw the progress made by the kids, things slowly sank in. The only source of motivation is the amazing staff and fellows we have here [and not to mention the kids]! At times, even at about 12:00 at night you\u0026rsquo;d see these folks planning out sessions or logistics for us the next day. They\u0026rsquo;re just SO much dedicated towards this movement that at times it all looks to be a dream\u0026hellip;\nSummer School - Class 3D\nSummer schools was probably the best that could have been planned for us. For kids this was a summer camp and for us quite learning experience. All through the four weeks, Staff, Program managers and Fellow advisors would constantly watch us while we deliver the lessons to the kids and provide critical feedback. About four fellows handle a class each taking about one or two sessions everyday. Pre and post Diagnostics help chalk the progress made by the kids during the summer Schools. At the end of the four week camp, the kids are better prepared to get back to their schools and so are the fresh fellows to enter their Placement schools where they would be fulltime teachers for the next two years.\nAt TFI, one centric belief is that we as a movement can bring about a transformation/change in the society only if there’s a transformation in each one of us as a person. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really appreciative of this till late. I just couldn’t find the ‘aha’ moments in my summer school while most around me seemed to be really enjoying their journey as a first time teacher. Later over time I realized, I could/would never look at the minor accomplishments that my kids had. I never took stock of the small things that happened every day in the class always concentrating on the bigger picture. Only after making a conscious effort to let loose, I really seemed to be involved and connected with the kids. Teaching only got interesting after that! Ever since, I make it a conscious attempt to see what each kid has to offer every single day and appreciate him/her irrespective of the scale of the progress and make note of it. Things have definitely changed. Now I think more than I used to think before and plan more than I used to plan before. My kids progress seem to have taken a higher seat than anything else and I’m more than happy to do anything that would help them inch that extra step forward.\nTomorrow by this time, fifty more fellows [The second batch of fellow/Tenners for this year] would be entering their own classrooms where they would teach and train for the next four weeks. They would co-incidentally be teaching in my placement school [Epiphany]. Time seems to have simply flown by! I remember myself in that position just about a month back\u0026hellip;\nBetween, over to my other passion of trekking; I managed to do the Katraj-Sinhagad moonlight trek twice again over consecutive weekends. This was during the institute and I still am surprised how I managed to pull it through. Last week I headed out to Kenjalgad with the DH team. Turned out to be quite an experience to start off with. I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure how much justice i\u0026rsquo;ll be able to do to this aspect going forward\u0026hellip;only time will tell\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/06/20/the-induction-wave.../","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt’s been close to two months that I\u0026rsquo;ve been with TFI. 1 week of induction, 4 weeks of summer school and 2 weeks of Placement school.  There\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot that\u0026rsquo;s been weaving around here.

The North/NE trip didn\u0026rsquo;t materialize, the bamboo shelter remains an open chapter and the Kanyakumari-Delhi ride somehow just cascaded into oblivion.

I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t have asked for a better vacation!\nLooking back on other aspects, I definitely have slacked a bit in terms of the outdoor activities. I\u0026rsquo;ve not been running and cycling as much as I wanted too. Probably it\u0026rsquo;s just the heat thats keeping me indoors. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t want this to be on the downswing so I\u0026rsquo;ve revisited this years targets. Last year I\u0026rsquo;d ridden about 1300kms so this time I\u0026rsquo;ve set my target to 2500kms. On the running front I need to finish a Full Marathon in about 3h45m. - The August Hyderabad Marathon should be a good target. Given that I\u0026rsquo;m heading out to Pune these numbers should be pretty much reachable, but only time will tell.\nComing to think of it, I am going to miss Hyderabad badly. It\u0026rsquo;s not that this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;m moving out of here. For four years during my undergrad and one year during my Infosys work life I\u0026rsquo;ve been away from the city. But then, I did have scope to head back as and when I pleased. This flexibility I\u0026rsquo;m sure not going to have for the next two years considering the kind of work I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing in the fellowship. I guess this time its going to be a long good bye to Irani chai and the Hyderabadi Hindi! I got to know quite a few interesting people through the Infosys journey and it\u0026rsquo;s sad I\u0026rsquo;m having to part ways just three years through. But the amazing time I\u0026rsquo;ve spent with them will truly remain embalmed.\nIn the month of July, most of my family would be coming down from the States for a long vacation in India. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I would be able to spend just a day or two with them. Opting to stay back in India, I just didn\u0026rsquo;t get to see the kids grow up and its sad I will not be able to be with them when they\u0026rsquo;re here. The way things work!\nAll this aside, I hope to make the next two years, one truly memorable journey. A journey figuratively interspersed with stations big and small, transgressing routes known and unknown. A journey that would ask of me in giving my ultimate best in understanding, motivating and hopefully transforming the lives of the kids out there. This part of my life, this little part, I hope marks the beginning of a fresh story. A story that gets the pages turning on and on.

A few days back, I was mentioning to a friend of mine – Kerala is actually not ‘Gods’ own country’ during summers. Today as I sit by the window of a state transport bus bound towards Ernakulam from Munnar, I take back my statement. The cool gusts of evening breeze from the omnipresent coconut and Banana trees, the winding roads cutting through the Western Ghats, the narrow age old over-bridges on the canals and water-ways, the yellow haze of the sun as dusk sets in and the distinct architectural splendor portrayed by each of houses round the corner - Cruising in 80s on the barely twenty feet wide ghat roads, I realize there’s something ethereal about this place as I’m left to the mercy of the short mustached man behind the wheels.\nI just got back home from a long – or should I say, very long trip from deep down south. This for one was way too different from my regular trips. There was quite an element of predictability and specific destinations and timelines were charted out even before I left Hyderabad. But looking back at the places that I’ve covered during this 17 day vacation and more so the short yet invaluable time I got to spend at each of these distinct locations, I’m more than glad things turned out the way they did!\nThe informal TFI meet at Pune on the 20th, for which I’d made last minute bookings and changes in my itinerary was quite worth the trouble taken. Though only about 30 folks turned up, the diversity in the group was quite evident. The \u0026lsquo;09 fellows seem to be as excited as we \u0026lsquo;freshers\u0026rsquo; were and I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s a lot we\u0026rsquo;re going to learn from their experiences in the next couple of months. As we get to know a bit more about each other three hours just flew by. At about 19:00hrs I head to \u0026lsquo;Park street\u0026rsquo; to meet couple of my old friends. A late evening dinner in a plush restaurant and I call it a day. The next day even before dawn sets in, I head to Deccan Gymkhana to watch a Basketball tournament of a friend of mine and the rest of the day is spent visiting old pals from the \u0026lsquo;Pune days\u0026rsquo;. At about 19:30hrs I barely make it to the station to board the Kanyakumari Express to head to Palakkad. The 32hour journey begins\u0026hellip;\n22nd March \u0026lsquo;10 - 23rd March \u0026lsquo;10 | Palakkad - Pallavur\nAs the train traverses through the four states - Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and finally Kerala, People move in and move out of the compartment. Apparently it looks as if I\u0026rsquo;m the only one in the compartment who\u0026rsquo;s completing the whole journey. At about 01:00hrs on 23rd, the train finally chugs into the Palakkad station. I decide to spend the next couple of hours in the station itself. At about 03:30hrs unable to get some sleep, I walk out. We once used to have a hotel here right outside the Railway station. Given the close proximity, there always used to be a flurry of activity at the hotel. Today as I stand by the land, I see that the place seems to have changed quite a lot and there are no signs of our once ancestral house. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit disturbing to find the house missing there and the present owner seems to have no plans to renovate the place. Its all shrubs and bushes. I wish we atleast had a photograph of the house and hotel before demolishing it\u0026hellip;With a heavy head I walk over to the Olavakkode junction. A rick from here takes me to the Town bus stand.\n23rd March \u0026lsquo;10 - 24th March \u0026lsquo;10| Pallavur - Killakotura\nI leave Pallavur that evening after meeting Paruammai at about 18:00hrs and board a bus that I presumed would take me to Palakkad. After about half an hour I realise I was heading in the wrong direction and hop off in a town called Killakotura. A few checks with the village folks and I get to know that the last bus from there to Palakkad just left. I\u0026rsquo;m left with no other option but to camp at the village. I wander about for sometime and finally manage to find a decent looking lodge. The manager offers a room with \u0026lsquo;All facilities\u0026rsquo; for 125 bucks. When asked about food in the whereabouts, he says he could send it over to the room. I happily accept and enter the room. For a small village as this, this was quite a luxurious room with TV and Air conditioning! At about 20:30hrs there\u0026rsquo;s a knock on the door. As I open it, a lady stands there with a food plate. She keeps the food on the table and asks - \u0026lsquo;Ethra manickura? [How many hours?]\u0026rsquo;. I instantly reply back in my primitive malayalam - \u0026lsquo;Night stay aana\u0026rsquo; [I\u0026rsquo;ll be staying overnight]. And then it looms on me where exactly all this was going! She walks out of the room and in a couple of minutes comes in with the manager. This chap re-verifies and finally when he realises what exactly has happened, he instantly says - \u0026lsquo;Zhorry..Zhorry\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;[Sorry..Sorry] \u0026lsquo; and walks out with the lady! I gulp the food with a vow to be on gaurd next time when someone says accommodation would be available with \u0026lsquo;All facilities\u0026rsquo;!\nThe next day morning I checkout at about 07:00hrs and head aimlessly through the village. At about 10:00hrs I manage to find a bus that would take me towards Palakkad. I change buses in between and finally reach Palakkad at about 14:00hrs. The next checkpoint was Trivandrum which was about 10hrs from Palakkad by train. I decide to cover this distance during the night and explore parts of Palakkad in the state transport bus. It was kinda good to just hop into buses aimlessly and just see where the bus was going. At about 21:00hrs I head back to Palghat Junction, have a light dinner, board Amritha Express and crash for the day.\n25th March \u0026lsquo;10 - 27th March \u0026lsquo;10 | Trivandrum\nNothing much done during these three days. I scrap all backpacking plans and just spend time at my grand mom\u0026rsquo;s place. The heat was literally beating the pulp out of me and I decided to take it easy. Went out for real long evening walks though, exploring parts of Trivandrum figuring out short cuts only to avoid them the next day! TVM had its first monsoon shower on 26th and it literally lashed the whole town - A much needed break from the heat!\n28th March \u0026lsquo;10 - 29th March \u0026lsquo;10 | Ernakulam - Vaikom - Kumarakom - Kottayam\nA friends wedding was on 29th at Vaikom. I decide to leave TVM on 27th and reach Ernakulam on 28th so as to catch up with two other friends of mine - Adi and Abi who were coming over from Hyderabad. At about 07:00hrs we board a bus from Ernakulam. It takes about an hour and a half to reach Vaikom and eventually the Guest house where we were put up. We head out to the Shiva temple and then for Breakfast. As I walk through the streets, a sense of belonging looms in. Despite Vaikom being my Maternal ancestors place, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been here before. My Mom and her siblings grew up here but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really able to trace out our ancestral land.Realising there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much I could do, I just felt contented that I could visit this place during this year.\nSushma - Another friend and Raji - the bride tun up in an hour or so. Time flies by as we catch up with the latest happenings in our lifes. We were meeting these folks after two and a half years and it already looks as if things have changed so much! As we meet more of her friends and family members we\u0026rsquo;re humbled by the hospitality we\u0026rsquo;re given. The day is dramatically wound up with a last minute shopping for \u0026lsquo;mundus\u0026rsquo; and Raji\u0026rsquo;s mehndi ceremony. The wedding next day is swiftly completed in two hours flat and we\u0026rsquo;re served a lip smacking lunch at the temple \u0026rsquo;sadya\u0026rsquo;. This wedding turned out to be one of the best ever weddings I\u0026rsquo;ve attended till date - short, sweet and no unnecessary fuss. Evening at about 15:00hrs we decide to head towards Kumarakom.\nFor want of time, we decide to engage a rick. and head to Kumarakom directly. For about 250 bucks, we\u0026rsquo;re shuttled from Vaikom over to this place in about an hour. We engage a boat for about an hour and a half for 450bucks and cruise through the backwaters and the Vembanad lake. I\u0026rsquo;m not really in for leisure \u0026lsquo;relaxing\u0026rsquo; rides. Such rides would best be enjoyed when you\u0026rsquo;re with your family or with a big group of friends. Nevertheless the ride was quite a stress buster and helped us wind out from all the travel related strain. A refreshing cup of coffee at the Kerala tourism department restaurant and we head over to Kottayam. Adi and I were to stay put at this place while Abi had to catch a Hyd bound train. We manage to find a decent lodge for 400bucks and crash out.\n30th March \u0026lsquo;10 - 31st March \u0026lsquo;10 | Kottayam - Muvattupuzzah - Kothamangalam - Munnar -Udamalpet\nTo avoid travel in the hot sun, Adi and I check out of the lodge at about 07:00am and head to the Kottayam bus stand. Some inquiries here and there and we figure out we\u0026rsquo;d just missed a near direct bus to Munnar. One of the conductors directs us to walk a bit ahead, get on to the other side of the bridge, Board a bus to Muvattupuzzah and figure our way out from there. In about an hour we manage to reach Muvattupuzzah and board the bus to Kothamangalam. Kothamangalam seems to be a bigger bus stand and you\u0026rsquo;d get to find a number of buses starting out from here towards Munnar. In a couple of hours we reach Munnar and directly enter a restaurant for a sumptuous lunch. For some reason, I do not get to sense the Kerala flavor at this place. Every second person talks in tamil and to add to that there was a new political party meeting with couple of ministers lambasting out on the speakers. Mani - an auto driver approaches us and proposes to help figure out an economical lodge and guide us around the place. We somehow seem to like the way he was taking his case forward and accede. In minutes we check in to a lodge and in about an hour Mani starts the guided tour around the place.\nLife in Munnar: Our decision to take Mani\u0026rsquo;s services seems to be quite fitting. He turns out to be quite an interesting person and the discussion moves on from regular \u0026lsquo;guide\u0026rsquo; talk to his life and how he was making ends meet. He tells us that he just enrolled his first kid in one of the finest english medium schools in Munnar and managed persuading the management to let him pay the 10grand capitation fee in installments. Since he had his own Auto, he would ride extra hours when required and could comfortably make 10grand a month. As we pass through the TATA Tea estates, he says he wished his wife could get a chance to work with them. All tea pickers are paid just about 140Rs. per month. But the facilities that TATA provides them is what, he says makes people eagerly look forward to employment with them. Apparently they\u0026rsquo;re provided accommodation and their kids are provided absolutely free English medium education and Transport. TATA also sends five students of their employees[tea pickers] to pursue their Higher education to Australia - All expenses taken care of! Given all this there was a catch in the employment - You would need to have a lineage to enter the job, something that he feels that wasn\u0026rsquo;t providing the remaining folks an equal opportunity.\nMani also brings out the dark factor of Munnar - Prostitution and Drugs. There\u0026rsquo;s just no dearth of both. When asked what kind of \u0026lsquo;guests\u0026rsquo; he\u0026rsquo;d prefer guiding - He promptly gets back stating anyone but for Israelis. For the reason that they generally look out for Ganja and he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to call for unnecessary trouble.\nSince this was a complete off-season, we end up paying 450Rs. for the first day and 650Rs. for the second day to Mani. And I\u0026rsquo;ve just no regrets about the amount spent! Should you happen to visit Munnar anytime I would highly recommend you reach out to Mani on +91 9495879103.\nThe winding roads and hills badly remind me of the Jalori pass mountain biking expedition I did early last year. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing worse than not having your bicycle in such amazing places. As we pass by the Annaimudi viewpoint I vow to get back here for a long Bicycle expedition sometime later this year.\nDone with the regular spots for that day, we head back home and crash out. There\u0026rsquo;s a thick mist setting in and the temperature is about 20deg. I find it hard to believe that I\u0026rsquo;m compelled to use a blanket even in Summer! The next day we travel a bit more farther and cover about 70kms of travel and sightseeing. Munnar apparently seems to be a proper tourist place. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing starkly different here but for the roads. I decide to head back to Trivandrum that very day while Adi stays back for one more day. A five hour bus journey to Aluva and then Ernakulam and I finally get to board the Kuchuveli express back to Trivandrum.\n02nd April \u0026lsquo;10 - 03rd April \u0026lsquo;10 | Trivandrum - Kanyakumari\nAdi gets back to Trivandrum at about 04:00am. We decide to visit the Anantha Padmanabaswamy temple and then head immediately to Kanyakumari. After a three hour long drive and two hour wait in the queue in the Boat jetty we realise the visit was just not worth it. Without second thoughts both head back to Trivandrum that very evening after visiting the Vivekananda Memorial. It so happens that this was a \u0026lsquo;Good Friday\u0026rsquo; and the roads are blocked because of processions happening. As the bus takes detours into narrow town roads, I\u0026rsquo;m amazed at the skills of these drivers. At one point of time he had to squeeze the bus up a 45deg. incline along with a tata sumo! Man, they can literally drive an elephant up your asshole and get it out without any damage! Finally we manage to reach TVM at about 20:00hrs.The next day is spent whiling away time at home and some evening Trivandrum \u0026lsquo;Dhekko\u0026rsquo;. Adi leaves for Hyd that very day and I follow suite in a couple of days.\nWith that ends my 17 day long vacation in Kerala!Despite not having elements of surprises, I would remember this break for quite a few reasons - Meeting Paruammai, Attending Raji\u0026rsquo;s spectacular wedding , Striking off Munnar from the \u0026lsquo;Places yet to visit\u0026rsquo; list and more importantly spending some real good time with my Grand mother and figuring out the family tree.\nI’ve been visiting Kerala almost every year, for the past twenty or so years. But it’s just in the last couple of years have I’ve sensed a change in the lifestyle . I probably do not have the rights to comment about the place since I spend just a couple of days every year, but for some reason I sense the people and the place as such is drastically changing. Change is inevitable. Development is very much required. But before we start transforming things for the greater benefit, unless we come up with an organic model to secure the time tested practices that are currently in place, we’re prone to lose out on the valuable and irretrievable balance\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/04/11/17-days./","summary":"\u003cp\u003e31st March \u0026lsquo;10.

The cool gusts of evening breeze from the omnipresent coconut and Banana trees, the winding roads cutting through the Western Ghats, the narrow age old over-bridges on the canals and water-ways, the yellow haze of the sun as dusk sets in and the distinct architectural splendor portrayed by each of houses round the corner - Cruising in 80s on the barely twenty feet wide ghat roads, I realize there’s something ethereal about this place as I’m left to the mercy of the short mustached man behind the wheels.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"17 Days."},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s about 04:30Hrs and there\u0026rsquo;s not a single soul or bus in the stand. At about 05:00hrs, a tea vendor rides in on his bicycle.

The bus lazily winds up the narrow roads and in about an hour i\u0026rsquo;m asked to pop off the bus. I straddle through the village roads and finally manage to reach the first landmark that my dad had given - A community pond just beside the Shiva temple. A bit of asking around and I finally make it to that distant relative\u0026rsquo;s house. This is the first time that I was meeting these people ever since I grew up and it takes a while to figure out where exactly they map on to me in the family tree. My main intention to come to Pallavur was to meet Paruammai. After easing out a bit with my newly found relatives, I check with them how I could get to her. She apparently was staying a bit deeper in the village and I\u0026rsquo;m told that she should be coming by this road at about 08:30hrs. As I eagerly wait for her I\u0026rsquo;m lost in thought as to how she\u0026rsquo;d be faring.\nAt about 08:45hrs, Paruammai finally comes by. I\u0026rsquo;m excited looking at her still able bodied personality - She infact looked much much healthier than she was when she left us years back. Must probably be the village air and water! Just one change being that she\u0026rsquo;s now got even bigger holes in her ears! Apparently, she does not recognise me in first sight but as I talk slowly and remind her of the yesteryear\u0026rsquo;s she simply acknowledges with tears welling up in her eyes. A long conversation ensues of things small and big, of people and kids she was acquainted with, of relationships sweet and sour and of times that just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get back. I show her pics of the now \u0026lsquo;big\u0026rsquo; kids[My Brothers, Sisters and Cousins] and their children and in a moments jiffy she runs out of the house, calling in people from the village to tell them how happy she was to see the light of this day - to see the pictures of the kids of the kids who she herself had raised. The excitement in her eyes and voice told it all. That very moment, I realise my Kerala visit and purpose was solved. This day for sure is one of those best days in my life till date\u0026hellip;She now is working [still strong at this age!] in a village teachers house taking care of their pet dog.I\u0026rsquo;m not sure If she would be around the next time I come down. But the photograph and the video that I took with her would remain one of my most cherished possessions for time to come.\nParuammai at Pallavur - 23rd March 2010 from Srikanth Perinkulam on Vimeo.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/04/11/meeting-paruammai/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s about 04:30Hrs and there\u0026rsquo;s not a single soul or bus in the stand.

Even before I meet them in person, I\u0026rsquo;m thoroughly stumped by the diversity that each of them are bringing with them in terms of their past work/study experiences. Excited is just not the word I can use here! And then after the Pune visit, unless my ticket gets confirmed I guess I would be traveling in a unreserved compartment for about 32hours to reach Palakkad[Kerala]. During this break, I initially wanted to tour all around Kerala as I was sure I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be getting this opportunity again..But giving it some more thought, I figured I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really gain much just roaming around and decided to spend more time with my people out there. Eventually It loomed on me that I should take time out and visit Paruammai . As far back as my memory traces, Paruammai\u0026rsquo;s been one woman in the whole family who has seen my generation take birth and grow up to what we are today. She moved in as a maid and became a intrinsic part of the family. Overtime as she grew old and moved back to her village - Pallavur with a wish to spend her last days there. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while that we\u0026rsquo;ve heard from her and I hope she\u0026rsquo;s still moving around in the village. She would probably be in her 90s now!! At times I wonder how we as humans just keep moving on and on without taking time out to stop, appreciate and thank those who\u0026rsquo;ve done so much for us\u0026hellip;With a hope that age hasn\u0026rsquo;t taken a toll on her, I just cant\u0026rsquo; wait to see her in person and have a long long chat with her.\nPost the Pallavur visit, I plan to head directly to Trivandrum and spend some real good time with my grandmom. Then there\u0026rsquo;s this Munnar trip saddled along with a friends\u0026rsquo; wedding blocked during the last week of march. If things don\u0026rsquo;t take an wild turn I probably would be back to Hyd by 6th of April. Haven\u0026rsquo;t as yet figured out what I\u0026rsquo;d be doing till the end of April. At least for now, the Ladakh or North East plan stays canceled for various constraints.

So here goes mine\u0026hellip;\nBCC Intentional\nOn March 10th, even before dawn breaks in, I would be out there on the asphalt roads - Running and training like never before. As I fix my morning breakfast and coffee, I would no longer have to bother about missing the 07:00am Bus. The very thought that I would not have to travel 30kms to reach my workplace gives me a sense a freedom like never before. Life’s just getting better by the day!\nAs I walk out of the gates on 9th, my 2.8 yrs in Infosys would come to an end. And today as I look back, I see I’ve taken more than what I’ve given to the company. It’s been a stupendous journey. I was lucky to be part of a budding unit and to have real cool managers; to be in a Production support project for about eight months and then a Process centric project for close to 1.5years. I never was keen on doing technical stuff and I’m so glad I wasn’t compelled to do it either! I flunked my certification five times and I’ve absolutely no regrets. The day I was offered a job as a Software engineer, I decided I would work on my terms and would not accept subjugation at any cost. I somehow felt my personal life was far more important than my work life. I stood by Kantabai’s philosophy [Itna Paisa Mein Itna Ich Milenga] and most of the days; I was in by 8 and out by 5. I can count on my fingers the number of days I’ve worked over time or over the weekends - All this without sacrificing on timelines or deadlines.\nConsidering my interests, Both the LexisNexis project at Pune and the Pfizer Change Management project here in Hyderabad have been highly satisfying. I simply couldn’t have bargained for more! Liaising with various teams across timezones, Scheduling releases and the best part - Anchoring escalation calls is something I’d cherish for years to come. I still wonder why people are so much against working in non-technical projects. There’s an equal amount of pressure and thrill involved and neither really gives you more pay than the other\u0026hellip;So what’s the big deal?\nOver the last two years, Infosys has given me an amazing platform to meet and network with quite a few real cool and interesting people. I’ve been part of dance teams [Hyd Milan ‘08] and skit plays [Raheem beedi!] which I’m sure I wouldn’t have pitched into but for my amazing team mates. I’ve been part of outdoor adventure groups [AdVentura and eventually HydVentura] and Biking groups [Thunderbolts] which I’m badly going to miss as I plummet out of Infosys in a couple of days. I picked up the guitar and tried my hands at Budokan Karate.[Haven’t made much progress on these but am sure will get back to complete this unfinished job!]. I’m going to miss all the events and DJ nights that keep happening so very frequently. And last but not the least I’m going to badly miss you folks who’ve always been out there to mimic back those thirty-two shining teeth. The lunches, the outings, the coffee breaks and the cross cubicle volley-ball games - It’s as if I’m putting a full-stop abruptly and vanishing out into the blue…\nBut I’m shit excited. Excited about the uncertainty that’s going to be with me, about the financial instability, about the responsibilities I’d be taking on, about the people I’m going to meet and more so about the kids whom I’ll be teaching and eventually learning from for the next two years. I’ve still not exactly figured what I’m going to do with my life. But I guess that’s what’ll keep me on my feet every day from now. Post my fellowship at TeachforIndia, I would probably pursue my childhood dream of having a ‘Dr.’ in front of my name or probably start something of my own. There are a lot of ifs and buts involved and I hope to figure the evens and odds in the two month break that I’d be taking. Guess I’ll just do what I’m best at – Backpacking across the country, trying to sink with the locals and take some real good time off. This phase of my life would probably be about crossing the narrow rickety bridge spanning hundreds of metres over a deep ravine - Options galore, But not really sure of what\u0026rsquo;s at the other end\u0026hellip;Life\u0026rsquo;s just getting fabulous!\nOne March 9th, One chapter ends and yet another begins and before I put a bookmark; I just want to stop by and thank you for having made this one memorable journey, to say the least. If you happen to stop by Pune /Mumbai over the next two years, do buzz me or fire me an e-mail\u0026hellip;I’d be all the more eager to hear the scoop from your end. For the next few days I should be reachable on 9885913093 and if not, I’ll just be a googol away…\nSigning off with tons of sugar [and two ounces of salt…]\nWarm Regards,\nSrikanth S.

As I walk off from the 20 member group to pick to rick to head to the Pondicherry bus stand, I\u0026rsquo;m still in second thoughts. Four folks who were supposed to join me for the Auroville run decide to back off. I\u0026rsquo;m down with a sore throat and the flu only aggravates it. As I\u0026rsquo;m almost about to drop the flag, a message from \u0026lsquo;Chottu\u0026rsquo; pops in my mobile wishing me a good run. I lurch into an auto and head to the Bus depot. A half an hour search for the right bus to Auroville and finally at about 20:30hrs I manage to hop off on the ECR beach road-Auroville stop. I remember seeing in the map that the organisers had provided, that the reporting point was about 4kms from the main road. Not able to find any ricks, I decide to walk down the stretch. About twenty minutes of walk down the winding narrow roads and dimly lit streets, I finally get to stop a rick coming in the opposite direction. I strike a deal of 150bucks for him to drop me at the Visitors center [another 4kms from that spot] and finally at about 21:30hrs I hop off the rick only to see the last set of folks boarding the last bus to the Dorm. I rush in and have a word with the organisers to keep the bus on hold for sometime. I\u0026rsquo;m registered as Runner#2101 and dash for the pasta dinner. In five minutes I gobble a full plate of lasagnes and pasta and head back to the bus. And from nowhere, this lad pops up! A quick catch-up and even before we realise we\u0026rsquo;re in the dormitory. Ankur was still on his was from Chennai. I send one last message from my power starved mobile and crash.\nFeb 14th \u0026lsquo;10 - 04:30hrs. There\u0026rsquo;s a sudden surge of activity in the room with runners decking themselves for the run. I kinda feel out of place seeing these pro\u0026rsquo;s gearing up for the run. At about 05:15hrs, We realise we\u0026rsquo;ve narrowly missed the shuttle bus that was supposed to take us to the start point. As we head to the main road to hitch a ride, a refreshments vehicle stops over. In about five minutes, the streaming voice of one of the organisers at the start point gets the blood to boil with energy. Runners from various places warming up, people swarming into the startpoint and registering their presence and yet another group cheers up as they meet a long seen friend. For me, this is the best part of any event - excitement, thrill, anxiety , emotion - It\u0026rsquo;s all in the air! Ankur eventually realises he would not be given a bib as he did not have a photo identity. Nevertheless, He decides to run.\nSharp at 06:00 the half marathon folks are given a go and even before I take my first step, I have a smile on my face - My second HM was just two hours away! People overtake you, you overtake people. The crowd isn\u0026rsquo;t talking much as they run. Probably it was just Ankur and me in the whole group who were out there babbling and catching up on the latest happenings in the cycling arena. Five kilometres into the run and the mind gets into a trance.The heart beats faster, the breath gets deeper and the best part of running sets in - the circuitous thought process. As dawn sets in, so does the beauty of the woods. We\u0026rsquo;d already left the asphalt roads about a couple of kilometres back and the trail starts winding through the mystic auroville village. The sun beams in onto the trails through the thick foliage of trees and the smell of moist sand takes you to an altogether different high!\nEven before I realise, I cover the 12kms mark. This was the first time ever that I\u0026rsquo;ve run continuously for such a distance without stopping! The ever courteous volunteers and bicyclists make the run all the more pleasant. Quick dashes of electrolyte, water and bananas keeps the feet chiming on to the ground. The last few kilometers as expected turn out to be a bit demanding. The sun\u0026rsquo;s already up and the humidity makes it all the more tough reminding yet again that I should have trained better! At about 08:15hrs, as I take a turn round the corner, the beats from the drums gets the pulse up. I summon my spirits and sprint to the finish point. The last 50mts I blindly close my eyes and run to where my feet take me to. As a volunteer gives me royal welcome with a \u0026lsquo;completion\u0026rsquo; medal, I gaze at my watch. My second HM is written out at 2h20m - About fifteen minutes off my target but I\u0026rsquo;m more than elated. This was THE best ever long run till date and as I walk out of the premises I promise to get back to Auroville for a Full marathon next year!\nI head back to Pondicherry and catch up with the remaining folks. An amazing evening in the beach and we head back to Mullodai calling it a day. Only at dinner does the body start complaining and the mind goes off balance. The run, the swim and the travel seem to be take a toll and a seething headache compliments the cold. I ravenously hog like a wild animal and head back to the Youth hostel as the remaining folks enjoy their dinner.\nDespite being irregular during the training, If there was something that got me on my feet on weekends - it was the thought of running through the woods. Auroville amazingly lived to that dream and I simply cannot stop short of praises for the amazing set of folks and volunteers out there who\u0026rsquo;d made the run so easy.\nAnd I just realised, I need to set a new target for my Dailymile tracker!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/02/19/running-through-the-woods.../","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYet another scooping rise from underneath - The water around blinds me out completely,  the leg craves for rest, but the mind defies succumbing to pain and the body just goes on in a sinusoidal motion towards a non descriptive goal.

I wanted to think on my toes and look for a challenging day ahead that would need me to take decisions on the fly. I wanted to have a slice of \u0026lsquo;adventure\u0026rsquo; every day in my life. Over time I realised its more promising to trust your gut instinct than anything else. I personally feel relying on \u0026lsquo;gut instinct\u0026rsquo; is not just doing things impulsively but It\u0026rsquo;s more about taking decisions on the fly which inherently is strengthened over time based on your past experiences through a subconscious thought process.\nA year and a half back I signed off my \u0026lsquo;one year in IT\u0026rsquo; post with this statement- \u0026lsquo;Probably I’ll be doing something starkly different next year or for all you know still be eluded by the mirage of recognition all the way lamenting ‘C’est la Vie ‘ and keep moving.\u0026rsquo; Little did I realise what was concocting. I should have seen this coming way back then. Three months from now I\u0026rsquo;ll be making a paradigm shift in my career and what else do I attribute this to but for one of Rohan Kini\u0026rsquo;s tweet!\nI guess its time I unofficially announce [For records!] my decision to move out of the role of a Software engineer and walk into the role of a teacher. I was intimated on my selection for this fellowship on Nov 30th itself but I guess it took me another two months to digest the fact. I\u0026rsquo;ll be joining a team of 150 fellows selected from various professions all across the country to mentor kids in low income schools. For two whole years, as a fellow of Teach for India, I would be working with the kids, their communities and their familes to help improve the literacy numbers. The very thought that I would be responsible in moulding the lifes of about fifty kids over a span of two years sends a chill down my spine.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been an excruciating three whole months process and I still remember checking my mail every half an hour on my mobile on Nov 30th awaiting the confirmation response from the team. [I probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t this anxious even during my Infosys interview!] I applied for the fellowship right the next day I got to hear about the program through Rohans\u0026rsquo; tweet. Initially I assumed this would be a cakewalk. But after a couple of days the structured process that was in place to take in the second set of fellows became evident. SOPs, Recommendation letters, Telephonic interviews and a day long in-person interview - Boy, I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t prepared for all this! I in fact didn\u0026rsquo;t even inform my family members till the day of the Assessment interview!\nPost my selection, life\u0026rsquo;s been a bit different. People kind of do not look at me the same way. All optimistic views aside, moving out of a stable job to unknown realms is at times unnerving. I\u0026rsquo;ve been receiving mixed responses from my colleagues and friends when they get to hear about my decision. It at times bothers when you hear your colleagues earning a higher pay as they switch jobs. To be frank, in the initial few days I was even thinking of scrapping all plans and banking on the safe job that I had. But as I got to speak to the current fellows and the program co-ordinators things really got better. A much deeper analysis and ground work put things on the brighter perspective. Besides this decision also had direct implication on what I wanted to do ever since I started teaching at the Arundati upper primary school. That one day changed the way I looked at things. Just two hours and I was already emphasizing on the need for a much regular workable model to help the kids improve and I guess this is where my gut instinct played a vital role. If I was not interested in the program I simply wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have applied for the fellowship impromptu. With that single ideology I sent in my confirmation on Dec \u0026lsquo;07th despite having time till Jan 03rd.\nThe next two years is probably going to be the best learning experience I could ask for. I would need to work on issues I\u0026rsquo;ve never thought of and look at things from a grass root level perspective. I would need to think twice before I spend every pie from my pocket and learn to un-learn some things that \u0026lsquo;corporate life\u0026rsquo; has taught me. I would need to think out of the box and bring about innovative ideas to help improve the current scenario. To be frank, I still do not have a clear cut picture as to what I should/would be doing post this fellowship. Guess I\u0026rsquo;ll take it in stride and figure out things as they roll out.\nEarlier this month, I came across this talk by the CEO of Teach For India - Shaheen Mistry at the TEDxASB event.

Nothing short of a three stomped salute.\n\u0026lt;\np style=\u0026ldquo;text-align:justify\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;\nIndia as a developing nation needs institutions such as this to help bring about change. Change in the way we respond to the seething demons that are deep rooted in our day to day lives. Unless Illiteracy, Poverty and Corruption are brought under control, there\u0026rsquo;s remote chance that we as a Nation stand to a glorious future. Philanthropy or Altruism come nowhere in the picture. All that is required is human force that believes in setting things straight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/01/21/gut-instinct-twitter-and-my-career/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to wake up in the morning and find the day ahead unpredictable.

Miles away, she\u0026rsquo;s someone who\u0026rsquo;s been such a wonderful source of motivation for each and everything I do - day in and day out and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any better way of thanking her than warding off my sleep to take snapshot of the amazing year 0f 2009!\nEver since I graduated, I decided I would do something starkly different or interesting every two to three years and this year very much stands as a testimony to that conviction.Over time I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt to set my priorities straight and involve in activities that I think really stand for what truly represents me. I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt to trust my gut instinct more than anything else and live by my passions irrespective of what others think of me. On a personal front this year has been one of pursuing my passions like crazy.\nByking:\nI\u0026rsquo;ve cumulatively ridden 1500kms the whole last year. That really isn\u0026rsquo;t much compared to what other serious bikers do but I\u0026rsquo;m more than happy with the progress I\u0026rsquo;ve made. Transitioning from a trekker to a biker has been one hell of an experience and has got me to see a whole lot of wonderful places.\nThe Enduro3 national level adventure race was one humbling learning experience where I really got to see what I was made of and what I could achieve. It sort of wedged out a window to judge my capabilities vis-a-vis expectations set by people. \u0026lsquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t snow here anymore!\u0026rsquo; This is what a villager up there in the lofty Himachal town of Jibhi had to say when we asked her about the weather there. Those innumerable climate change articles never really had any impact on me till I went up there on those mountain peaks. The Jalori Pass Mountain Biking expedition slammed me right on the face and got me thinking on what damage we \u0026rsquo;enlightened\u0026rsquo; people are causing. We snub our noses when we see someone damaging our property. Think of those people up there in the himalayas who\u0026rsquo;re bearing the brunt because of our insensible activities. The Korlai Ride was yet another stupendous ride that I would cherish for years to come. 205kms spanning three days in the mystical sahyadri ranges. It was just the man, the machine and nature! The Freedom Ride on the other hand was clearly something that cut across the point - It\u0026rsquo;s just not about the bike! 180+ riders riding together on Roadsters, Targets, Meridas and what not for 63kms on the roads of Hyderabad for the kids of Akshaya Akruthi. Boy, that was one hell of a ride! Running:\nI started running seriously sometime early in August and have clocked about 120kms till now. When I ran my first half marathon this November, the only goal I had in mind was to complete it without any glitches. I ended being ranked 100 out of the 220+ runners. For me personally, it\u0026rsquo;s not the distance or time that really matters. It\u0026rsquo;s more about the thought process that goes on in my mind during the run that I\u0026rsquo;m really interested in.\nTravel:\n2009 hasn\u0026rsquo;t really been a year of travel for various reasons. But then in those seasoned escapades, there\u0026rsquo;s been a lot of takeaway.\nThe Bidar ride - 20 riders, 10 bikes all set to explore the ramparts of the Bidar fort! The Kalsubai Conquest - As I scaled up Maharashtra\u0026rsquo;s highest peak, a friend acquainted from a bus ride plopped off the Chembra peak. Life\u0026rsquo;s so unpredictable! The Kawal Wildlife Sanctuary - Stuck miserably for five grueling hours with four people I\u0026rsquo;d never met before in a wild life sanctuary with temperature soaring to 40 deg. Real testing times\u0026hellip; The Junglethlon - Three days of Jungle survival course with a bunch of real interesting people. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t ask for a much better way to close the 2009 chapter! Career:\nThat day simply changed my outlook towards things and eventually my career. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably save this for another post but in the nutshell, a solid seed was borne early this June and I\u0026rsquo;m more than excited about things\u0026hellip;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s about 01:15am here and the \u0026rsquo;new year\u0026rsquo; has already sprung in.

My year end outdoor escapade then was to either ride through Kerala in the second week of December or ride to Araku over the Christmas weekend. Eventually November and December turned out to be pretty hectic, with very little time left to put forth an action plan. With all plans crashing I hesitantly decided to head to Pench for the Junglethlon. Activities abound, days flew by and it was already time for the Pench visit.\nThe event was for three days starting December 25th. Ram and I had initially decided to reach Nagpur a day in advance and visit the Kanha Wildlife sanctuary. A bit of googling and we realised this plan was not really feasible as Kanha was about 255kms from Nagpur. A day before we depart from Hyderabad, I check with Pradeep on \u0026lsquo;places to visit\u0026rsquo; around Nagpur and jot down a couple of locations.\nDecember 23rd - Wednesday\nWe\u0026rsquo;re at the station by 20:30hrs all set awaiting the arrival of Nizamuddin express. The train was scheduled to arrive at about 22:30hrs. As we idle away time, I realise it\u0026rsquo;s close to about a year that I last travelled by train. For the last few months, most of my travel was impromptu and bus travel [tickets being the easiest to get at any point of time] somehow turned out to be my first preference. Both have their pros and cons but what I guess starkly differentiates the two is the diverse mix of people that you get to see in the railway stations - People from all sections of the society waiting on the same platform for a single train that would take them to different locations. The electric vibe in the air, the wails of kids, the confused masses, the stark gaze of an old man spanning into infinity, the distant sound of an engine lurching ahead, Hawkers by the platform side and not to forget the incoherent announcements - There\u0026rsquo;s just no reason to get bored!\nThe Nizammudin Express finally chugs into the Secunderabad station at about 23:00hrs and we almost instantaneously crash.\nDecember 24th - Thursday\nAt about 08:00hrs the train reaches Sewagram. Some real hot and spicy cabbage vada in the chilling weather makes for a real good start of the day. The train chugs into the Nagpur station at about 10:00hrs. We have a quick breakfast and pick a rick. to the Nagpur Bus stand. Despite Pradeep warning that heading to Pench wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really be a good idea given the non availability of accommodation, we\u0026rsquo;d decided to head to the Pench reserve directly the previous night. A few enquiries at the \u0026lsquo;help me\u0026rsquo; counter and we\u0026rsquo;re asked to board a bus to a place called \u0026lsquo;Parshivani\u0026rsquo;. Pench was supposedly only about 10kms from there. In high spirits we locate the bus and manage to reach Parshivani at about 12:00hrs. This is when we realise that this place just didn\u0026rsquo;t have any \u0026lsquo;decent\u0026rsquo; hotels for lunch. After a lookout for about half an hour, we finally manage to find a road-side dhaba which served pure shakahari and pure Maansahari food! A quick lunch here and we head back to the Parshivani bus stand. In a couple of minutes we\u0026rsquo;re already heading towards Pench in a jeep.\nOnly when we get there and meet the caretaker of a guest house do we get to know that we\u0026rsquo;d come to the Maharashtra side of the Pench reserve. Apparently one could not enter the reserve through this side and accommodation was not available as prior permit had to be taken. The caretaker explicitly mentions the route that we had to take to reach the MP side of the reserve. To be on the safer side we almost make up our mind to head back to Nagpur and call it a day when we meet yet another wayfarer. This gentleman provides us a simple illustration of the exact place where we were and suggested that we head to a place called \u0026lsquo;Ramtek\u0026rsquo; instead of going back all the way to Nagpur. The fact that accommodation would be pretty easy to find at this place further prompted us to follow his advice. A twenty minute ride back on a rick to Parshivani and we board a bus heading to Ramtek. A few inquiries around for a decent guest house and we\u0026rsquo;re directed towards \u0026lsquo;Ramgiri\u0026rsquo; lodge. For 450 bucks this was a real decent place. A quick shower here with the luxury of hot water and we head to the Ram temple which could be seen right from the lodge.\nThe view of the sun rays slowly lapsing out on the temple walls with the chilled breeze wafting the village air across was quite a motivating factor to get over to the temple as early as possible.The short hike up the temple along with the langurs made for a decent warm-up. The thin air and the unspoilt silent ambience in and around the temple was quite a refreshing experience. We then head to a close by place which seemingly looked like a mini auditorium with a huge central fountain. With none around and just the reflection of the water starkly lighting up the mandaps, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the Bhimashankar trek experience. We finally decide to head back to the lodge. A bunch of kids from a school in Amaravati had come down to Nagpur for an excursion. We hitch a ride in their bus and get dropped off at the by-pass. Some real good dinner at Ramtek and we call it a day.\nDecember 25th - Friday\nThe day starts at about 06:00am with a real hot \u0026lsquo;adrak\u0026rsquo; chai and the laughter and shouts from the folks in the opposite building practicing some tantric yoga! At about 09:00am we check-0ut of the lodge and head towards a religious setting called Ramdham, at Mansar. A quick breakfast here and we idle away some time before Manu and Pradeep stop by to pick us up. There were surprisingly only two other ladies - Shreya and Avani. Evidently this Junglethlon was going to have just the six of us! As Manu cruises on the NH7 we get to know a bit about each other. In about half an hour we stop by Khawasa where Pradeep hires three \u0026lsquo;Dhoodhwala\u0026rsquo; roadsters for us to ride down the next 12kms towards the \u0026lsquo;Tigernwoods\u0026rsquo; resort which would be our pseudo home for the next three days. The ride through the concrete roads pervading into the buffer zone of the reserve serves as a wonderful warmup. Shreya and Avani try their hands on the roadster and Shreya manages to get some real sweet bruises with a couple of falls!\nA sumptuous brunch and Manu takes us around the place/resort. Later after some formal introductions, Pradeep lays out the cards as we relax in the Machan. Todays\u0026rsquo; task would be to build a machan by ourself. We\u0026rsquo;re shown around the place and asked to build a strategy to design a shelter that would house six of us for the night. We have a look at the Machans that were already built by the villagers and get an idea of what we would be requiring to get things started. It all looks to be a simple task only until we get to start working. With quite some deliberations and revisiting our strategies we finally decide to build a simplistic shelter with six \u0026rsquo;ladder\u0026rsquo; beds and a fireplace. We divide the tasks of ground clearance, raw material foraging and material setup among the six of us and start working on them. Pradeep goes about explaining how to cut wood and helps in assisting in setting up the Parachute shelter. It\u0026rsquo;s already close to 05:00pm and we still haven\u0026rsquo;t even completed one ladder build. Dusk was soon setting in. We finally decide to stay in the machans that was already made by the Resort and continue the shelter activity the next day.\nLater part of the evening is spent around the Bonfire with some real good snacks, drinks and banter wheeling all around randomness, life, Quantum physics and what not! At about 23:30hrs we decide to call it a day and crash.I decide to crash out in the open machan. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t take much time to black out despite the chill and a disturbing call from my folks out there\u0026hellip;\nDecember 26th - Saturday\nBy about 06:10hrs we head towards the Pench tiger reserve for the Safari hoping to spot tigers. Despite Pradeep booking it online a couple of days earlier, we find it quite a task to enter the reserve. A guide is finally allocated for our gypsy and at about 07:10hrs we enter the reserve. About two hours in the reserve and we\u0026rsquo;re not really successful in spotting any \u0026lsquo;wild\u0026rsquo; animals but for wild boars, sambars, deers and Nilgais\u0026rsquo;. The presence of a couple of volunteers from WWF makes an interesting end to the safari. We head back to the resort and get to hear from a couple of other folks who\u0026rsquo;d gone to \u0026lsquo;Alikatta\u0026rsquo; [A place in the reserve where a tiger show is held with the help of Elephants.] that even they weren\u0026rsquo;t able to spot the tiger!\nPost lunch at the resort we\u0026rsquo;re given our next task to make fire. Boy, till date I never thought this would be that big an issue! We almost spent a whole hour and a half trying to \u0026lsquo;make\u0026rsquo; fire using a magnifying glass! Later as Pradeep shows us how fire is made out of tinder and other raw materials we\u0026rsquo;re more than thankful for his guidance. We then get to task to get the shelter up and set. We decide to shirk the plan of creating ladder beds and instead flatten out the base and use a plastic sheet for the base. The flattening is completed pretty quickly and in minutes our shelter seemed to be taking shape. A wonderful fireplace is built at the center and we\u0026rsquo;re almost set to camp! This done, Pradeep takes us out from some jungle navigation and obstacle crossing. By example we\u0026rsquo;re made to understand how important being focused and topographically aware one needs to be when present in an unknown location. The usage of the Sun and moons\u0026rsquo; direction to help navigate was yet another wonderful take-away - The crest of the moon always faces the west and on a full moon night the bunnys ears face south! We finally reach back to the resort and enter our shelter. After a quick chat Manu, Ram and I decide to head to Koka lake for a short bike ride. This is when Manu realises his Merida\u0026rsquo;s pedal had jutted out of the crank. Nevertheless we have a sweet 6km ride to the lake and back on the roadsters. Ram eventually follows Shreya\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;gracious\u0026rsquo; fall example thankfully without any bruises.\nOnce back to the resort, we have some real good snacks - Avani helps Siddique - the chef prepare some real yummy Paneer Mushroom pakoras! The rest of the evening is spent singing classics and discussing stuff. As the night churns in some more bad news flows in through the mobile and I\u0026rsquo;m taken for a bad toss. There was nothing I could do sitting this far so I gulp it in and decide to enjoy the rest of my stay. As per the lots that we\u0026rsquo;d taken earlier in the day two of us were to be on the watch in shifts all through the night by the fire. Pradeep and I are on the lookout while the remaining four snore in mighty glory for two hours. Avani and Shreya apparently stayed awake post that followed by Ram and Manu.\nDecember 27th - Sunday\nThe day starts a bit late at about 08:00hrs. We have yet another splendid breakfast and then Pradeep introduces us to a game of Croquet. Indeed an interesting game and this almost eats up the rest of the morning. We finally decide to do some Riverbed Running. A quick hike to the river bed and a decent run of about 8kms in the scenic Pench forest made for a wonderful end to the Junglethlon.We\u0026rsquo;re back to the resort by about 13:15hrs when Manu makes some Glucose drink for the team. A quick lunch and we push towards Nagpur at about 14:20hrs.\nEn-route Pradeep takes a detour to show us a school that he is helping build. It currently has about 25boys and 25girls . The central curriculum is to teach them basic computer operations and get them involved in the Pench tiger reserve activities. What better way could you help in giving a growing generation an oppurtunity to give back to the community that they belong to? Well, staying with him for the past few days I should stop myself from getting amazed by the activities he does. For someone who\u0026rsquo;s scaled Mt. Everest, Professionally sky-diving for the past seven years, been in the army for quite a few years, institutionalized a Business school in Pune, completed a Ph.D in Knowledge management and currently pursuing one in Quantum Physics, this just seems to be a speck on his achievements! That\u0026rsquo;s one thing I love about adventure - You get to meet such amazing people that you simply start challenging yourself for your next move trying at best to emulate them!\nWe almost make it on time for the Jaipur special train at the Nagpur station. Avani camps at Shreya\u0026rsquo;s uncles place for a couple of hours before heading to Mumbai. Shreya is to leave for Calcutta the next day while Manu and Pradeep had an altogether interesting drive back to Delhi planned spanning through Rajasthan! The train reaches Hyderabad one solid hour before time! Head back home, complete a few pending activities and head to office at about 07:00am!\nOne interesting end to the year of 2009! And it feels great to be part of the first ever Junglethlon! There apparently is a lot in store in the forthcoming editions and I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll not think twice next time.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing as yet planned for this new year - Probably will head for a longish bike ride\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2009/12/29/the-junglethlon/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe first time I got to hear about the Junglethlon through facebook, I RSVPd blindly considering it to be yet another event and planned to keep it as a backup option.

Incessant campaigning in various companies and support from few big shots gets the real undercurrent for the event set. We were absolutely overwhelmed by the response the event received.

This was not something I would miss at any cost. Having miraculously walked out unscathed through two major accidents, it was a lesson learnt the hard way to be equipped with at least minimal knowledge of first-aid. My futile attempts to try out CPR on a badly injured neighbour whom I was pillion riding with 9 years back and the Oil tanker incident four years back where I was equally helpless flashed out of memory as the detailed practical session commenced.Though I could not attend the whole two day program due to personal commitments, it was indeed one of the most fruitful programs / meets I\u0026rsquo;ve attended of late.\nUnfortunately, here in India, most of us take things only on the frontal perspective. You do not learn or do something unless it is mandated and the pivotal source of information is available only to those who choose to delve in. Its an irony that even preliminary information is not dissipated to the masses and even if it is, it is done in the most rudimentary form that effectively does not make sense. Basic first aid sessions is something I guess every individual should be introduced to, irrespective of age. To be able to sustain a weaning life and if required, be responsible to keep the flame burning is a chance that we always hope does not cross our paths. But given todays\u0026rsquo; fast paced life and highly inorganic growth in the cities, chances are pretty remote that you would see a day pass by without hearing an Ambulance hooting out there on the roads.\nGiven the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m much more active outdoors than indoors [I sometimes wonder how I even ended being a Software Engineer!], I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to update this post as and when I come across relevant information catering to first aid. That said, there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no substitute to practical demonstration. So do attend a certification course whenever possible!\nIn case of any eventuality perform DR.

Goal three got frozen right then!\nTraining for the HM wasn\u0026rsquo;t that great. As much as I\u0026rsquo;d loved to join the HRC members for a good run, distance of KBR park from my house was a big turn off. With no company to train in this part of the city I\u0026rsquo; d started relying on dailymile for constant motivation and keeping those numbers up as days progressed [eventually \u0026lsquo;spamming\u0026rsquo; my twitter account with training updates!]. Well, It did the trick! I managed to do a 10k and subsequent 6-7ks over the last couple of weeks. Though physically not that prepared, mentally that almost got me set for the 21.1k run. One day prior to the run, I made it a point to stay back at home and avoid any physical activity. Gulped litres of water and a decent carb. loading. A quick call with Ram to get some motivation and I was all set for the kill!\nNov 22nd - Sunday\n05:00Hrs. The ambience was pretty electric at Peoples Plaza. About 220 runners were all geared up for the HM. The 10k folks were yet to arrive as their run was to start at 06:30hrs. At about 05:40 hrs, the group is fired off. Weather\u0026rsquo;s pretty good and the darkness gives good company. Even before you realise you\u0026rsquo;ve run a couple of kilometers, dawn breaks in and you\u0026rsquo;re directed towards ranigunj. Rock bands en-route give the necessary thump and slowly the ordeal begins. People move over to the sidelanes, stop by for water at the water stations but still move on. The AP police force make the roads clear at all traffic points. By-standers cheer you all the way and even before you realise you\u0026rsquo;re almost near the 10k mark. A few more kilometers and you reach Charminar. That is when I resolve to complete the HM come what may. It was as if this monument was effusing some positive energy that I never experienced before. The pain in the knees lingers but some unknown force motivates me to keep the leg moving. People over take me and I overtake people. Something in the air makes you feel more close to Hyderabad!\nThe last one kilometer is an amazing mix of emotions as we meet the 10k folks and run the last one kilometer together. There are no medallions this time at the finish line. Just a group of ebullient people amazingly self satisfied about their achievement. But what humbles you is septuagenarians and serious runners congratulating you wholeheartedly! The ambience is extremely cheerful and even before I realise, I\u0026rsquo;ve completed my first Half Marathon! I had no target in mind when I was training for the marathon. All I wanted was to complete the HM without any setback. But when I look at my watch,I realise i\u0026rsquo;ve clocked about 2hrs. 20mins.

The volvo comes to a halt at Jagtap Diary. Bani is right there waiting to receive the four of us from Hyd. Sumanth, Mohan, Sudhansu and I had left Hyd for Pune yesterday. We reach Bani\u0026rsquo;s house by about 06:45hrs. It\u0026rsquo;s close to 08:30hrs by the time we refresh, get the bikes set and have a sumptuous breakfast at Yogesh\u0026rsquo;s place. While I head to Dange chowk to meet Viral and Trupti, Bani and the remaining three head to Vishal nagar to get their bikes mended. We decide to meet at Tammana restaurant, Hinjewadi at 09:30hrs. A quick catch-up here and the ride begins. The target is to reach Roha by 19:00hrs. That translates to about 125kms of biking today and effectively my first century ride!\nTen minutes on the road is more than a glaring pre-cursor as to what we could expect for the next two days. Even before we could hit Pirangut, the gradient starts increasing. We stop over at a roadside shop for a quick refill of water and move ahead towards Mulshi dam taking a right at the Pirangut chowk. The landscape changes starkly as we head towards Paud. The air thins down and the effect shows on the lungs as cleaner air sinks in. The next eleven kilometres from Paud is more or less on flat terrain traversing through small towns and riding by the Mulla river. Bani catches up pretty quickly and we ride in tandem for quite some time. The best part of long distance bicycling is that you get to talk leisurely as you ride on.\n35 kilometers into the ride we approach the Mulshi dam at the place where the Mulla river originates. Bani had warned us of a steep uphill climb close to the Mulshi dam and even before we realise the killer climb loomed right ahead. An ascent of a kilometre or so brings the muscles into action. Sumanth, Mohan and I take a short break at the hairpin bend letting the body cool down. Couple of minutes spent here and we push ahead and take a left turn ahead only to find Sudhansu riding back just to check if all is fine with us! A bit ahead we take a brief stop at one of the hotels facing the reservoir, waiting for Mohan to join us. As we relax in the shade munching on jaggery bars, the body starts talking sweetly to the mind. And it’s just about 40kilometres into the ride.\nAt about 13:00hrs we reach a roadside restaurant for lunch. A heavy [and costly!] lunch here followed by a much needed half an hour break and we decide to move on towards Tamhini ghat. The section from Palase to the Tamhini village is interspersed with quite a few scenic viewpoints overseeing the Mulshi waters. The weather gets better and by the time we reach the Tamhini village diversion point a refreshing shower gives the body a cold shock wave. Further about 10kilometres ahead is the breathtaking Plus valley. A brief stop-over for a couple of photographs and then we head towards the Tamhini ghat. It’s about 17:00hrs. The road ahead seems to penetrate into infinity as the sky gets overcast. Sounds from the innumerable streams cascading from the towering ranges abutting the road on the left side, seem to be magically muted by the strong gusts of wind. There\u0026rsquo;s not a soul on the road kilometres ahead and kilometres behind. I stand upright on the pedals letting the rules of physics govern my motion. As I dissolve myself in the encapsulating ambience capturing every frame with my closed eyes, the stark phenomenon of passage of time becomes evident. One year back I was right here on this road in a cab. Today nothing has changed - Just that I\u0026rsquo;m on a two wheeled machine powered by just the mind and the legs. Tamhini ghat has always been on the radar of un-accomplished rides for almost a year now. Couple of months back I had to miss one of the planned rides because of work commitments and today as I ride on this heavenly road, I’m speechless. For a couple of moments, all pain vanishes and what I get to experience is something which I guess would remain etched in memories for a long time to come.\nBani and I pullover to the side as Sudhansu, Sumanth, Viral and Mohan zip past us at the beginning of the ghat section. Dusk was setting in and we decide to sweep the team. 9 kilometres of complete downhill on the ghats can be real risky with vehicles spitting in at break neck speeds. We stop for some tea at the end of the ghat section and then proceed towards Vile. The next major town would be Kolad where we would be hitting the NH17. My body starts giving in at about 85kilometres into the ride. I’m compelled to stop intermittently to avoid impulsive heart beat surges. I take it easy for a while intently listening to telling signs and keep moving in a slow pace. There’s just one motivation to move on – to see to it that my first century ride does not turn out to be disappointing. At about 95kilometres I suddenly seem to get energy out of the blue to move on ahead. I take it in stride and gracefully ride ahead of the team. I’d forgotten to take my cyclo-computer for this ride, but the road markings out there were quite reliable and based on a rough estimates I should have completed my first century ride at Sutarwadi. I stop by the ‘Empower adventure training camp’ for sometime for rest of the folks to join me and once everyone’s in, we ride on towards Kolad.\nAs dusk sets in, things get easier. With LED headlamps and rear flicker lamps navigating through the roads gets all the more interesting. The beauty being we’re compelled to ride together and match the pace of the slowest member of the team. As we reach the NH17, navigating on the roads gets a bit dicey. At about 19:30hrs we hit Kolad. Viral suddenly seems to be smitten by the night queen and he powers down the road like never before. The remaining five of us ride in tandem. At about 20:00hrs we finally reach our chalked out destination at Roha– Hotel Dwarka. A staggered dinner at Navaratna hotel, thanks to the pathetic service and we crash in the lodge. A hot water bath [Geysers here are powered by LPG!] does the trick and even before I realise I’m in dreamland.\n20th Sep ’09 – Sunday\n05:45hrs. As I wake after seven hours of decent sleep, I test to see if my ass still pains. Surprisingly it doesn’t! The elation only lasts till the moment I jump onto the saddle after checking out from the place. There seems to be no cure for it and the ride has to go on. Today is going to be one long day. The plan was to head to Korlai fort [About 40km from here], spend about an hours time there, head back to Roha by noon, have lunch here, then proceed towards Kolad, Vile and then finally scale up the Tamhini ghat at night and camp at the start of the Ghat. That totals to about 120+ kms of ride and 9kms of ghat climb at the end.\nWe checkout at about 06:45hrs and ride ahead towards Korlai. The roads to start off seem to be pretty flat [Rather Pune flats, as Bani calls them]. Yesterdays’ sound sleep seems to have rejuvenated the muscles. I feel real fresh and but for the ass pain everything seems to be perfectly fine. I cruise ahead and go with the swing. Climbs with increasing yet manageable gradients soon pitch in making the ride all the more interesting. About 20kms from Roha, there’s this small dockyard where iron-ore is brought in to the hinterland. We stop here for sometime and then move on.\nAbout ten kilometres ahead we come across a small village. A much needed heavy breakfast [Lip smacking Sheera, peppy hot Vada-Pav and crunchy toasts] at Pooja’s hotel and we move on towards Korlai. At about 10:45hrs we reach the Korlai diversion and ride into the village. The poor villagers are taken back with the sight of six nuts blistering through their streets on bicycles. Bani leads us through the village and then finally after some decent off-roading we reach the Korlai lighthouse. I stop a bit ahead, bank my bike on the rock and conk off for about twenty minutes blissfully sinking in the Arabian sea. The humid air and the cold breeze wafting across your body as you lie there staring into the open sea, with a bicycle beside you that’s got you 160kms from the mainland – Now that’s called living life!\nAfter a five minute snooze, I head towards the Korlai fort where the remaining five folks had already scaled up the fort. The caretaker directs me up the fort and I wait for the team to complete their exploratory mission at the entrance of it. In a couple of minutes as the five get down, Bani reveals that there’s a change in plan. We’d be heading to Kashid beach instead of getting back to Roha and then hit back to Pune the next day. The plan sounded pretty interesting and I was instantly game! Sudhansu and Bani decided to head back to Roha to collect our luggage while Sumanth, Viral, Mohan and I relaxed by the Arabian sea. At about 12:30hrs we head back to Korlai and then to Borili for lunch. With no options left, we had to satisfy our tummies with the veg thali available in the only restaurant at Borili and head back to Korlai and wait here for Bani and Sudhansu to return. Once they return, we decide to find a means of transport back to Pune tomorrow and an accommodation for tonight. At Borili, we manage to hire a tempo for 2grand and accommodation at the same place where we had lunch. Everything in place we decide to head towards Kashid beach and get back tonite to the lodge. Kashid beach is about 15kms from Borili. The roads are mostly flat but for the last section which is a spine thrilling down slope with a spledid hairpin bend. [Viral seems to have had a near miss smooch from a vehicle coming from the opposite direction!].\nThe Kashid beach is one of the best beaches I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been to till date - Amazingly clean, Happening crowd and sparsely visited! After a bout of yummy maggi and some real hot tea we decide to head back to Borili. It\u0026rsquo;s already 19:00hrs and the road is pitch dark. An unwritten understanding passes on that we\u0026rsquo;re to move together all together for the whole stretch. Bani leads and I sweep. That 15kms is one of the best team rides I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done till now. All the way through, uphill or downhill, riding in synchronism in darkness - I would call it the real icing on the cake! We reach Borili at about 20:00hrs, have an \u0026lsquo;unhealthy\u0026rsquo; oily food at the Chinese stall and retire to our rooms. Sudhansu comes up with an idea to head to the Korlai fort again the next morning and most of us immediately are game.\n21st Sep \u0026lsquo;09 - Monday:\n05:30hrs. There\u0026rsquo;s not much to ride today - Just about 10kms probably. We head to the Korlai fort at about 06:00hrs. Viral and Mohan manage to capture some amazing sunrise shots and I get to explore the fort which I missed on yesterday. By about 07:30hrs all of us are back in the lodge. The Tempo lad whom we\u0026rsquo;d engaged yesterday turns up pretty much on time and at about 08:30hrs we head back towards Pune. A short pit stop at the same Pooja restaurant for breakfast and we\u0026rsquo;re all set for another ass paining ride back to Pune. We stop by Sudhagad - Pali for respite and then head towards Wakad. With this the Korlai ride comes to an end. A quick catch-up with Trupti, Rahul and Reetika and we head towards Brehman circle for the bus to Hyd.\nThis has been one interesting long ride! With a special thanks to Yogesh and Trupti for lending their bikes and of course Bani for mapping the whole ride out!\nStats:\nMembers : 6 Distance covered : Day 1 - 130kms Day 2 - 65kms Day 3 - 10kms Route : Daily mile Bikes : 3 carried from Hyd by Volvo, Two arranged at Pune ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2009/09/28/the-korlai-ride/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe road ahead seems to penetrate into infinity as the sky gets overcast.

The human wave is flagged off right on time post the Flag hoist at 7:15hrs. The 62kms ride begins. My first ever long ride post the chestburn. If completed, this would be the first non-stop continuos ride without long breaks. I\u0026rsquo;m much wiser now with the Carb. loading for the whole last week and the early morning replenishment of banana shake. Besides, the plan mentioned thast replenishments would be available en-route as and when required.\nWe exit the city contours through the BHEL road. Amazing weather sets the pulse on and we start averaging about 20kmph. Riding through the service lanes on the roads ablely guided by the ever cheerful volunteers at vital junctions, we cross ICRISAT and a few kilometers ahead turn left to head towards Shankarapalli through Banur. Mobile replenishment stations and equally spaced out rest stations make riding an absolute cake walk! We take a three minute break at ICFAI Business School at about 40kms and get back to jackhammering the pedals.\nA few kms before we hit the Mumbai road, we\u0026rsquo;re invited by resplendent green farms on both sides of the road. Nature starts tantalizing us with a light drizzle and swift gusts of wind. As I glide through the roads completely mesmerised by the smell of the soil and the pastoral surroundings, flashes of reports from the newspapers wade by. Its the mid of August and monsoon has not as yet set in most parts of the country. Several states have been almost declared drought hit. Latest IMD forecasts do not seem to be positive either. Agricultural situation seems to be quite precarious. Power cuts would soon be the next tarot cards with the Government. The Central bank would be chipping in soon to check on the inflation. Govenrnment seems to be gearing up its water reserve measures. All this amidst a supposedly mid-Monsoon phase. This summer seems to be one dicey season. Where are we headed to?\n63 years of independence. What independence are we celebrating when the future itself does not seem to be rosy? Every second person on the road today has his own vehicle. Every chap who graduates from the 12th grade dreams of having a bike of his own. Every other person who enters the corporate mainstream signs in papers for the latest brand car. Public transport is rarely used by the so called elite class. Travelling in metro rails and state government buses is considered to be portraying a low status in the society. Most evident reasoning given - \u0026lsquo;Waste of time, Dude\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Insufficient buses!\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Lack of connectivity\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Pollution\u0026rsquo;. People get a life. It\u0026rsquo;s all about setting your priorities right. Your work will not be hampered if you reach couple of minutes late! If time is the issue - Start early. Wake up early. Bad traffic ? - Mate, the traffic is because YOU are creating it. You\u0026rsquo;re just adding on to the stack of multitude issues!\nA set of kids ebulliently waving flags by the road get my thoughts back. We soon hit the Mumbai road and head towards the Kothaguda Junction. Five more minutes and we\u0026rsquo;ve given a royal entry into the Novotel hotel. 11:05hrs. Other riders soon start swarming in and we head to one of the conference rooms. Couple of interesting events by kids from a dance school help sink in the post ride pains. A touching oration of the Vandemataram song by a Akshaya Akruthi special kid and a sumptuous lunch brings the first edition of the Freedom ride \u0026lsquo;09 to an end.\nAs I request the organisers to deliver my bike at Banjara hills and walk out of the gates of the Novotel hotel, I sink back in thoughts on how much passion for Biking changes the way we think. Earlier this year i\u0026rsquo;d been for the Enduro3 race and to say they\u0026rsquo;ve been orgainising the event for the past eight or so years is a shame on their part. This debut ride organised by these folks passionate about biking was one of the best ever organised events I\u0026rsquo;ve been to! Right from the initiation to the end of the event every aspect - Timely availability of replenishments, Spacing out of volunteers, Medical support, SAG wagons, Rest stations, Mobile support etc was taken under consideration. To say they\u0026rsquo;ve set a benchmark in organising events would be an insult! Kudos to the amazing team of volunteers and Organisers. Eagerly looking forward to the Tour de Republic ride!\nSpecifics:\nDistance: 62kms\nRegistered Riders: 179\nCause: Proceeds from this event would be routed to underpreviledged children to fund their education\nOrganised by: Atlanta Foundation\nFurther details: Freedom ride \u0026lsquo;09 Website\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2009/08/16/the-freedom-ride-09/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe atlas cycle in front of me squeaks as the rider careens into one of the construction sites of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.aliensgroup.in/\"\u003eAliens group\u003c/a\u003e. As I follow in tandem, I\u0026rsquo;m swept over by the cheers of the construction workers standing by the gates to welcome us into the rest station. Thumping music pulsates the 100+ crowd and the support they were profusely displaying for the cause was quite evidently portrayed in their charismatic faces. Each one ebulliently clapping and swaying as if they\u0026rsquo;re inviting the unbeatable winner of the Tour de France in regal honors! I\u0026rsquo;m at a loss of words to portray those emotions.

Definitely a serious concern. I call up dad, Inquire where he is and ask him to tag along. We finally decide to head to AMS at vidyanagar. A quick ECG and a 2D echo state that everything is perfectly fine but for some hyper-activity. Apparently my body was revolting yesterday\u0026rsquo;s ride for some reason. Sounds weird to me because, I in fact felt much more energetic when I reached home!Besides, this is not the first time I\u0026rsquo;m riding this long a distance. The doc gives me a sarcastic look and asks me to be under \u0026lsquo;observation\u0026rsquo; for a night. I instantly refute. We strike a deal that I\u0026rsquo;d stay at my friends place overnight and get back if at all the need arises. Abhi, Adi, Pavan and Praveen almost instantly drop by to see how the \u0026lsquo;patient\u0026rsquo; is faring. Sigh!\nOnce I reach Abhi\u0026rsquo;s place I doze as if I\u0026rsquo;ve been drugged. Next day morning is just like any other day. Some pain still lingers but that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much ignorable. It\u0026rsquo;ll probably be a while before the muscles get released and I get to breathe deeply and laugh my heart out. And till then it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Playing safe\u0026rsquo;.\nLooking back, this weekend has sort of chalked some lines. As people get to know innumerable calls ring in giving \u0026lsquo;gyan\u0026rsquo; on why one shouldn\u0026rsquo;t cycle, how harmful pollution is, how uncanny these roads can be, how bad the traffic is. I just nod my head and cut the call. There\u0026rsquo;s just no point talking to people who\u0026rsquo;ve no idea what they\u0026rsquo;re preaching doing nothing about the situation in hand.\nOkay. To the point. So why did the chestburn happen at all?\nI do atleast a 30kms every weekend. Last weekend was just a 10km ride. So probably the pulse was down. Last week\u0026rsquo;s been a real busy week at work. Those \u0026lsquo;supposedly\u0026rsquo; important meeting led to me reaching home at 22:00hrs every day. Lunch for some reason was not \u0026lsquo;carb\u0026rsquo; rich and back home that late I didn\u0026rsquo;t eat real well. Okay, I agree. I pushed myself a bit hard on the return journey. Fewer breaks [Infact just two!] and very less liquid intake. [Just one glass of lemon juice and a tender coconut] may have probably aggravated things. Lessons learnt:\nWatch your carbohydrate intake before any long ride. Be rich on liquids and drink frequently. Build the pulse in a slow gradient. Don\u0026rsquo;t look for a direct explosion :) Never.Never stop riding! Every sport has its negative effects. You realise things only when you experience them. People don\u0026rsquo;t make an issue of sports injury due to tennis, cricket or golf. But when it comes to cycling, it becomes a BIG issue. For others out here,things you MUST read before you decide to point fingers:\nEx-army man cycles against all odds The TreeCycle initiative - Shrenik Rao The road to delhi There are many people out there who\u0026rsquo;re doing things much more intense, spreading a message and bringing a change.

These kids from the Arundati Upper primary school have just three people to teach them-Two ladies [ One who is just recuperating from an operation and the other being the Head mistress] and a septuagenarian gentleman who\u0026rsquo;s been voluntuarily teaching them for the past two years. The community that runs this school wants to raze this down and build a complex here instead. That would equate to about 100 of these kids losing one last oppurtunity to get a hold on their lifes.

There\u0026rsquo;s a fan or two in the building with no Power to run them.

The screeching bus and incessant traffic honks for the past two hours or so aid in a poignant continuation to the so called semi-annual meet at work. My weary mind slowly starts easing out as I get down from the bus and walk back home from Habsiguda cross-roads. As I enter the colony, a waft of breeze somehow seems to carry away all issues with it and slowly the ambience sinks in.\nLooks like there\u0026rsquo;s been a decent shower in this part of the city and as is characteristic, there seems to be no power. The colony surprisingly seems to be pretty silent. The central garden which otherwise is paraded by health conscious people and of late couples, seems to have no visitors today. There\u0026rsquo;s not a soul on the road. No kids wailing, no dogs barking. All of a sudden, it all looks as if I\u0026rsquo;m the only one living in this society. The roads seem to be much wider and all that illuminates it is the moonlight making its way down here through dense clouds. A gentle drizzle starts and as Henley\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Hotel California\u0026rsquo; from my music player echoes down my ear canal, I somehow feel the drizzle giving lfe to the stoic road. It\u0026rsquo;s like I\u0026rsquo;ve found company for my walk back home.\nFor some weird reason, my thought process catapults me back to this realization. This is probably the second shower that we\u0026rsquo;ve had since the monsoon has supposedly begun. The Met center forecasts a below normal rainfall this year and in ways relating this to what the people in Jibhi had mentioned about the lack of snowfall for the past two years, somehow brings out a chill down my spine. I desperately seek to ward this thought off but the truth still remains. It\u0026rsquo;s all just a game of Dave. Knowingly or unknowingly we\u0026rsquo;re jumping from one foothold to another in search of the unknown or in the quest for that final destination; quite obliviously disregarding what we\u0026rsquo;re leaving behind. The real question is how much fuel would be left, as we pass on the torch of life to the forthcoming generations.\nWhen I was a kid, I had a fancy for bikes and cars. I in fact dreamed of becoming a cab driver one day! Today I literally feel like showing my third finger to people out here who commute alone even for short distances in their personal vehicle. My friends and relatives, all the more. People, If you think you\u0026rsquo;re saving time[and money] in commuting on your own vehicle to work and back; believe me you\u0026rsquo;re no wiser than a 10year old kid. It pains to see so many so called knowledgeable people depleting resources in thin air for nothing at all. The other day, I was going through a very interesting presentation on how road traffic could be starkly reduced if even fifteen percent of the current vehicular population shifts to Public transport. Lesser noise, lesser pollution and quicker transit. What else could you ask for? Damn, I lose a fucking five hours a day in travel! At the end of the day, It\u0026rsquo;s not the work that tires me. It\u0026rsquo;s this pollution and noise during the travel that fatigues me out. At times, I wonder why we humans fail to pick the baton and walk the talk when we have the solution right in front of us. It\u0026rsquo;s just about getting the wheel rolling. Just a minuscule change in the way you do your day to day activities for the good of everyone around you. Who cares?\nThe power suddenly fires up in the electric wires above me and then in minutes, the colony is back to life. There\u0026rsquo;s a sudden flurry of activity. Kids suddenly pop from nowhere, A baby starts wailing out of the blue, there\u0026rsquo;s this Pressure cooker whistling out - all just like a tape being re-winded and suddenly played.

The central idea is to travel in groups. When I say groups, that could range anywhere between say 10 to 30 for one trip. Well, this is also one of the reasons why couple of my colleagues and I started HydVentura- The Hyderabad adventure club. It gives us a big platform to group up and wind out on weekends whenever possible. For long trips on the other hand, I save over a period of time [six to seven months] specifically for this. This could mean cutting my expenses on things that are not really essential [Movies/Branded clothing for instance]. Also, It\u0026rsquo;s been close to a year that I\u0026rsquo;ve bought petrol [ I have a beast - The lumala which I ride on wherever I need to go]. So that fund gets allocated to this bucket.

I bluntly retort to Bala that his altimeter was wrong for some self motivation and crave for my calf muscles to stand with me. Every revolution on the crank seems to sap the almost drained out energy. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t want to push my bike up the slope in the last one Km! I close my eyes and pedal almost oblivious of the steep valley to the left, give it all I have and in that seemingly endless five minutes and finally reach the next milestone which hazily reads - Jalori 5km.\nIf there was a device on earth that could register those few important moments, I would have done my might to procure it and put it to use here. There\u0026rsquo;s this quite prominent line that says its the destination that\u0026rsquo;s not important but the journey that leads you there. At 3500mts above sea level, about one-third the height of Mt. Everest. I realize just once again how true this is as my second personal goal for this year is checked off list in the thin air of the Himalayas.\n21st May \u0026lsquo;09 [Thursday]\nThe Spice jet flight taxies for about twenty minutes in the airport and finally comes to a standstill. Animesh and I pick a rick and head to Cannaught place. Animesh primarily wanted to purchase a filter for his SLR. Before heading to Palika bazaar we randomly enter a small restaurant named \u0026lsquo;Rajdhani\u0026rsquo;-a Gujarathi restaurant. In minutes we\u0026rsquo;re guided to an empty table and the waiters throng the table filling the plate with an assortment of dishes. Even before the platter is empty another waiter pops by to ask if we need anything. If exemplary service had an epitome, this was it! Even before we realise, we are done with a regal lunch in just fifteen minutes. One another stark feature at this place is that you just do not have to rise from your chair once you sit at the table. A person walks up to you with a cistern and a bowl for you to wash your hands.I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen this at any restaurant till this date!Kudos to the Rajdhani management.\nWe then head to Palika Bazaar and shop around for the filter. It\u0026rsquo;s close to two by the time we find the exact piece and finally decide to head to the Travels through which we\u0026rsquo;d booked our bus for Aut - The base camp for the YHAI Mountain biking expedition. A series of calls, quite a lot of search and we finally get to reach the travels by around 16:00hrs only to find out that the boarding would have to be done at another point which was a fifteen minute walk from there. At about 16:30hrs we manage to reach the BP petrol pump which was supposed to be the boarding point. Co-passengers soon start dribbling in and we start guessing as to who would be joining us for the seven day expedition. The Bus leaves Janpath at about 17:40hrs.\n22nd May \u0026lsquo;09 [Friday] - Day 0 - Reporting at Base camp\nA mild jerk wakes me up and I can barely shut my eyes having got a glimpse of the picturesque view from the window. The bus was cruising at about 80kmph on a narrow road winding amidst towering hills on one side and a pristine river in its early morning bliss. A look at my watch registers the time as 05:45hrs. Soon the bus enters into a tunnel which we later get to know to be about 3.5kms long! This is probably one of the longest tunnels I\u0026rsquo;ve ever travelled through. The bus comes to a halt and we\u0026rsquo;re told to get down here by the Bus attendant. The village just seems to be coming to life and the air is crystal clear with barely any evidence of pollution. A few posts which I\u0026rsquo;d referred to indicated that the YHAI hostel was barely 100m from the bus stop. We check with people around for the directlions only to be turned down with a negative response. None of them had heard of anything called - Youth hostel. Just as we turn around to find the way ourselves a lad pops from nowhere and directs us to walk some distance ahead to reach the building.\nAs we reach the building, we\u0026rsquo;re surprised to see no-one around. Animesh dials the number on one of the posters and finally someone by name \u0026lsquo;Dimple\u0026rsquo; opens the door and invites us inside. Evidently, we\u0026rsquo;re the first two to reach the base camp for this expedition. This YHAI hostel is situated on the banks of the Beas river which silently winds its way across behind it. As we refresh and get ready, another person by name SishinderKumar introduces himseld as the camp in-charge. In a couple of hours five people from Bangalore chip in. Some initial formalities, a round of quick introductions then followed by a quick breakfast, Animesh and I decide to head to Kullu which is supposedly about 29kms from here. Sishinder suggests we visit the Vaishnodevi temple which is about a few kms from Kullu. We hitchhike a ride and get down quite some distance ahead of Kullu as Animesh wants to capture a very old bridge in his camera. A few quick shots here and we pick another bus to Kullu. From the Kullu bus stop we happen to board two more buses to reach the Vaishnodevi temple. I was literally intrigued by the architecture of this place.The sanctum sanctorum is on the fifth floor of a building, the best part being, it is enshrined in a cave! Each floor seems to be housing a different deity. This is the first time ever that I\u0026rsquo;ve come across of a temple being built in this style!\nWe finally get back to the Kullu town and head to a tibetan restaurant to try out some ethnic dishes. A quick round of Siddhu [Steamed Bread stuffed with assorted grains and spices] and Thupka [Noodles in a spiced gruel] and we board the bus back to Aut. A journey of an hour and a half and we finally reach the YHAI Hostel. As soon as we enter the hostel a gentleman brings his hand forward and introduces himself - \u0026lsquo;Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Bala from Bombay\u0026rsquo;. Regular round of introductions and soon we have a quick lunch. The Bangalore folks[Dinesh, Ravi, Shanker, VInay and Sharon] had apparently left for Manikaran for some sight-seeing. At about three pm, the ninth member-Viral makes his entry soon followed by the four Soni brothers [Rakesh, Gopal, Kishan and Vipul]. As dusk sets in, Shishinder Kumar starts doling out his experiences with YHAI and the innumerable interesting incidents. We\u0026rsquo;re informed of the next days plan. Dimple confirms he would not be lending us the bicycles till the next day morning and after a sumptuous dinner we crash.\n23rd May \u0026lsquo;09 [Saturday] - Day 1 - Orienteering and Trial Run\nBy 07:30hrs we\u0026rsquo;re all set. Dimple hands over to each of us a ruck sack and asks us to carry a thick Rug and a water bottle. The plan was simple - Hike up to a temple about three kms away gaining a decent altitude and get back by 10:00hrs. As we wind uphill it takes only moments for us to digest the picturesque Himachal moutains and hillocks. Winding roads, Thin chilling breeze, Horses grazing by the hills and the warm sun slowly bringing life about. Shanker seems to take the bait and finds it a bit difficult to take it all in. Animesh of all the people has a great time what with school kids all around and the farmers tending to their farms early in the morning. We finally reach the temple at about 08:30hrs.Some time spent idylling here and we finally head downward.\nDown at the base camp we get to know there are no more new entrants to the team. So the count is frozen at 13. After a quick breakfast, the rest of the morning is spent with Bala, Viral and Animesh debating on indian polity and other miscellaneous topics. Dimple distributes the gear and cycles post lunch and at about 15:00hrs we gear up for the evening warm-up ride.The rain delays the plans and we finally end up completing a decent 20+km ride followed by a ice-cream treat from Viral. By the time we reach the base camp, S.S.Heera - the program director and Nandakishore had already reached the place. Nandakishore does some \u0026lsquo;Gyan baant\u0026rsquo; on team work and mental preparedness followed by an interesting session by Heera on the foundation of YHAI and its core working model. Soon we\u0026rsquo;re also introduced to Bindu, who would be with us for the next few days all through the expedition. A sumptuous dinner followed by an idyllic chat and soon we crash for the day.\n24th May \u0026lsquo;09 [Sunday] - Day 2 - Aut to Pharghu Pul\nThe 13 member team is flagged off at about 07:00hrs. Dimple guides us through the 3km tunnel and until Largi and from there directs us to ride along to PharguPul which would be our next campsite.\nThis is supposedly about 22kms and definitley not by any means simple for a mediocre cyclist too. Every turn round the corner your hope for a downward slope is blurred with an upward gradient. Viral seems to be leading the trail and somewhere around Bali, I manage to catch up with him. We wait for sometime here and are soon accompanied by a dog which in the next few days we realise would be with us all through the trip. We move two kilometers further and wait for the Soni brothers to join us. Bindu meets us a bit ahead and informs we\u0026rsquo;re just about a km from the base camp. With full enthu we now head to the base camp. A left at Phargu Pul and a few metres ahead we finally reach the Phargu Pul base camp. Pramod and Ashok [ The cooks at the camp] give us the welcome drink and after about half an hour, Viral and I decide to get back to the Bus stand at Phargu Pul to direct people to the camp. Bala soon joins us in about fifteen minutes followed by Animesh and the Bangalore folks. Animesh apparently had a great time striking a conversation with the localites there and got quite a few good shots.\nWe have a quick lunch and head to the adjacent river for a shower. The chilled water literally freaks the soul out of us! Dinesh and Ravi manage to prepare some hot water by the riverside. Animesh, Viral and I head out to the village skirts for a short evening walk and get back to the camp by 19:00hrs. The rest of the evening is spent lazing in the camp playing cards as the rain compels us to be indoors. A decent dinner and we\u0026rsquo;re done for the day.\n25th May \u0026lsquo;09 [Monday] - Day 3 - Phargu Pul to Jibhi\nAt about 09:20hrs we depart from the Phargu Pul campsite and head towards Jibhi through the Banjar town. Though this stretch is not as picturesque as the previous one, it is mottled with steep inclines. But for the last two kilometers, this 17km stretch is an absolute test of your endurance! The first four kms lead you to the Banjar town and is landscaped with noisy streets and narrow roads. Viral and I finally catch up at about 10kms from Phargu Pul. At one point we\u0026rsquo;re almost sapped of all the energy that we have that we stop for about 10mins. A few yards ahead we meet two bikers from Australia who were heading in the downward direction towards Manali. We move ahead a bit more and round the corner happen to find a water source trickling from the hills. As we refresh here, taking in the chilled water, A jeep which was headed towards Rampur stops by. The driver tries to coax us to ferry us to the base camp. We stay put and decide to head to the camp riding-come what may.\nAfter a decent break of about fifteen minutes we head towards Jibhi. After about half an hour we finally reach the 2km milestone. Couple of wayfarers had mentioned the last two kms would be a perfect downhill. With that motivation we head downhill in full gusto. At one point of time we were in real good speed that we had to shout our hearts out to ask the people who were laying the road out there to move out of our way! Reaching the Om Shanthi Om resort was an eternal bliss! The resort was by itself set up in a mind-blowing location and facilities were Godly! Animesh, Bala, Soni Brothers and the Bangalore group soon trickle in.\nPost lunch, Bala orders some Pakodas and almost everyone feasts on what was supposed to be Bala\u0026rsquo;s lunch! Another shower in the freezing waters and we head back to the tents for some rest. VIral, Animesh and I head to the village-skirts in the evening and sink in the countryside. Towering trees, gushing streams, kids idylling away, pleasant chilled breeze - You rarely get to exsperience these in the cities these days. We head back to the camp site and decide to purchase some muchy stuff for the next days ride. We soon end up striking a long conversation with the woman in the store. As she goes about describing the culture, we\u0026rsquo;re shocked listening to the change i in just about 17kms! People here are so welcoming that you feel you\u0026rsquo;re in a totally different world.\nAfter a long conversation we take leave and head to the campsite for dinner followed by campfire. The day takes its toll and we soon hit the beds.\n26th May \u0026lsquo;09 [Tuesday] - Day 4 - Jibhi to Shoja\nWe\u0026rsquo;re flagged off at about 09:30hrs from the Jibhi base camp. The previous day was a cake walk compared to what we had to undetgo on this stretch. This was supposed to be a 7KM ride, but the altitude to be gained was quite a lot!The not yet constructed roads made things much worse. Enroute we infact happened to meet Israeli Bulleteers who at times found it hard to match pace with us! At about the four km mark Animesh joins us. All through Viral and I had yet another company - The dog! Bala soon joined us at about 2kms from the final destination. A few kms ahead viral\u0026rsquo;s cycle chain gave in and we had to push the bike uphill with no option left. We proceed uphill, pushing and riding intermittently.\nThe milestone reads - Shoja 1Km. The three of us are literally panting for breadth. The altimeter on Bala\u0026rsquo;s digital watch states 400 more metres are to be covered. Far ahead we see a state transport bus inching its way up the curves of the road. A gust of wind gets the thin air moving and suddenly from somewhere I get this urge and energy to pedal the last km of upslope. I bluntly retort to Bala that his altimeter was wrong for some self motivation and crave for my calf muscles to stand with me. Every revolution on the crank seems to sap the almost drained out energy. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t want to push my bike up the slope in the last one Km. I close my eyes and pedal almost oblivious of the steep valley to the left, give it all I have and in about five minutes I reach the next milestone which hazily reads - Jalori 5km.\nI\u0026rsquo;m on cloud nine! The bicycling stretch had been completed! The next 5kms stretch to Jalori pass would be done the next day by walk. We have a yummy feast with Maggi and Coffee and latermove out to explore the fields. As we sit in the basement of one of the old rustic houses, a frail old women asks us to come over to the verandah in the first floor. Animesh, Viral and I fall into a conversation with the old lady and her daughter-in-law. While Animesh rushes to get his camera, the lady doles out about her ancestors and then nothing in particular. As we plan to leave the daughter -in-law shows us a few things that she\u0026rsquo;d made at home - Phoolae- Shoes made out of grass and Pattu - a garment that Himachal women wear above their regualar clothes something akin to a shawl. The old woman turns out to be a pro-saleswoman and in minutes boosts the price of the goods. We promise to return in the evening as we didn\u0026rsquo;t have any cash then. Later we realise that to be a wise decision as the same item was available for half the price at a nearby store!\nWe later explore some beaten track in the evening and after a good dinner sign off the day.\n\u0026lt;\np style=\u0026ldquo;text-align:justify\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;27th May \u0026lsquo;09 [Wednesday] - Day 5 - Shoja - Jalori Pass - Phargu Pul\nAt about 06:00am we head to Jalori Pass by walk. A decent hour and forty five minutes walk up the winding roads and we reach the summit. Jalori Pass written off the checklist of things to be covered! There\u0026rsquo;s a small temple up there and about 5kms ahead is a hot water lake.\n\u0026lt;\np style=\u0026ldquo;text-align:justify\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;\nDue to paucity of time we start heading back to Shoja after having breakfast at the peak and reach the Shojha camp by 10:30hrs. Lunch followed by some rest and we finally push off to the Phargu Pul base camp at about 13:30hrs. Viral happens to have a bad fall off the bike. So we take extra precaution while riding down, get his wounds nursed at Banjar and finally reach the Phargu Pul base camp at about 15:00hrs. I\u0026rsquo;m compelled to drop the Ludhiana visit for Rahul\u0026rsquo;s marriange as breaking from the group at this point would seem quite out of the funnel. Another rejuvenating dip in the frigid beas river followed by yet another dinner and we call it a day.\n28th Mat \u0026lsquo;09 [Thursday] - Daty 6 - Phargu Pul to Aut\nThis would be our last ride back. At about 08:30hrs we leave from Phargu Pul and head towards Aut. I make it a point to take it easy and ride as slow as possible digesting the ambience around. The MB09 batch happens to meet us somewhere around Largi. In royal camaraderie we wave at each other and proceed to the tunnel. Finally as all of us group at the tunnel entrance, we fuel the human train and in about fifteen minutes we reach the Aut base camp. We decide to check out that very same day and head to Manali after lunch. At about 14:30hrs we board a bus to Kullu and from there to Khakhnal. The Youth hostel at Manali is located at Khakhnal which is about 9kms before you reach Manali. The Soni Brothers, Viral, Animesh and I head to a supposedly popular Karthikeya temple, while away time watching people gamble right in front of the temple in the vast expanse and finally head back to Sarthak resorts. The Bangalore folks decide to head to Rohtang pass the next day and checked if I were interested in joining them. I outrightly accept and after a sumptuous dinner crash in the dormitory.\n\u0026lt;\np style=\u0026ldquo;text-align:justify\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;\n29th May \u0026lsquo;09 [Friday] - Rohtang Pass\nAt about 05:30hrs the six of us head to Rohtang pass in a Sumo. We pick up the woolen garments en-route at shop 38 where Tenzing, our guide for the Rohtang Skiing joins us.As the road winds up the scenic himalayan range we soon notice we\u0026rsquo;re just one among the hundreds of vehicles inching their way up the roads to reach Rohtang pass. Tenzing teaches us the basics of skiing and in minutes we\u0026rsquo;re left to ourselves for about an hour and a half in the white landscape. Rohtang pass is supposed to be the origin of the River beas and a temple is built here to demarcate this. We finally decide to head to Solang pass for Paragliding at about 12:00hrs. As luck would have it, it starts drizzling and the program stands cancelled. With not much options left we finally head to the Vashisht temple and from there to the Manali Pvt. bus stand where my bus to Delhi was to depart. A leisure half an hour is spent in the Piccadely restaurant and at about 17:30hrs the Bus departs to Delhi. Animesh leaves a bit early by another service while Viral and I leave by the 17:30 service. The Bangalore folks had their bus about an hour later.\n\u0026lt;\np style=\u0026ldquo;text-align:justify\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;\n30th May \u0026lsquo;09 [Saturday]\nAt about 07:00hrs the Bus reaches Janpath. Viral and I proceed to the Metro station at Palika Bazaar.Viral leaves for Dwaraka while I head to Ajmeri Gate. Vairavan was supposed to join me here from Chandigarh but had to opt out in the last moment. Rishi happens to be around and soon reaches the station by around 9:00am. We spend a couple of hours in the station and at about 12:00am I decide to rent a room in a lodge close by and crash. My train to HYd was at about 17:30 and I was least interested to roam on the Delhi roads. I manage to find a decent place and get refreshed enough to leave for Hyd later in the evening.\nAll in all this has been the best ever vacation in my life. Ten whole days of being away from the hustle bustle of city life, almost totally disconnected from regular friends and family members with nothing but a bike and twelve other people from diverse regions in India to give you company in probably one of the most panoramic locations in the world. Moments that I would cherish for years to come!\nPhotos Coutesy: Animesh, Bala\nMisc:\n\u0026lt;\np style=\u0026ldquo;text-align:justify\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;No. Of days: 10 [7days biking]\n\u0026lt;\np style=\u0026ldquo;text-align:justify\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;Approx.

I follow suit.\nApril 30th \u0026lsquo;09\nWe\u0026rsquo;re to leave Gachibowly by 16:30hrs. 17:30hrs and Guru is yet to receive his 1942 Ford Jeep by which we were to head to Nirmal forests for a three days quarantine in a wildlife sanctuary. The five of us [ Guru, Ani, Ramraj, Venu and I] finally get to leave Gachibowli at 20:00hrs after a series of delays. Snailing through the city\u0026rsquo;s traffic we finally touch the outskirts by about 21:00hrs exiting through Shamirpet. A splendid ride for about an hour and a half and we break for dinner at Gangaram. Thanks to the military canvas water sacs slung on either side of the jeep, we have some real good chilled water. Soon we push towards Karimnagar via Siddipet. A lorry driver guides us through the Karimnagar town and from the outskirts asks us to drive straight towards Lakshettipet. Nirmal is supposed to be about 30kms from here. Thanks to a rick plying at those early hours we\u0026rsquo;re re-directed to the right path and at about 03:30hrs we finally reach the Jannaram Police checkpost.Asif from HYTICOS shows us the dormitory where we were supposed to camp. Remaining folks who\u0026rsquo;d left by bus to Hyd were yet to reach Jannaram.We crash at about 04:00hrs.\nMay 01st \u0026lsquo;09\n06:00hrs we\u0026rsquo;re woken up and asked to leave. I\u0026rsquo;m asked to join three others - Anirudh, Sandeep and Amit who\u0026rsquo;d reached Jannaram at about 01:00am. We\u0026rsquo;re to scout for pugmarks and collect tiger scat in the Pemble region of the Kawal wildlife sanctuary. Rajyam- a local villager was to be the tracker for the next few hours. Directions are pretty simple - follow the tracker, grab decent scat samples and pugmarks and get back to the base point by 10:00hrs.\nThe Pimble region is about an hours drive from Jannaram. A quick round of tea and we push off to Rajyam\u0026rsquo;s village. Sandeep hands over rice, dal and vegetables for them to cook lunch for us. We finally leave for the estimation exercise by 07:30hrs. Rajyam directs us through a few villages and finally to a point where the vehicle couldn\u0026rsquo;t move any further. We start the exercise and soon spot pug marks and scat samples. A hike of about an hour or so and we have a decent number of scat samples. Quite a few pugmarks are identified to be from leopards, tigers and bears but no detailed analysis could be done as most of them were on loose soil and the impressions were not distinct enough to make PoP moulds. Rajyam finally states there\u0026rsquo;s a high probability of finding animals near a river bed which is supposedly just a km away. We\u0026rsquo;re all excited and start moving in that direction as led by Rajyam. A few minutes into the walk, we see the first ever wild animal since the start of the exercise- a wild boar. It makes a quick noise to the right and runs in an undestined direction towards our rear. This pumps up our adrenaline a bit and we move ahead hoping to have the sighting of another wild animal. A few more sctas and a bit further we see a couple of Sambhars strolling lesuirly.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost 10:00am now and still Rajyam\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;one km far\u0026rsquo; river bed is not to be seen. The sun is slowly burning more and more of Hydrogen and the effect is very well seen at this non descript location in the Kawal wildlife sanctuary. Finally after about half an hour of walk Rajyam is elated having reached the waterbed. No animals out here but the very satisfaction of having reached here brings in some respite. Then out of the blue it suddenly strikes me, how unmindful we\u0026rsquo;ve been in trampling our way to the riverbed and in our quest we\u0026rsquo;ve mercilessly forgotten that this is a goddamn wildlife sanctuary - the courtyard of carnivorous animals. Probably I was just getting a bit more aware of my surroundings. Wandering in a wild life sanctuatry is so exhilrating! You know there\u0026rsquo;s nothing much that can be done in case a wild animal wants to make a sweet meal out of you but at the same time there\u0026rsquo;s this urge to explore and be in the vicinity of just another species of nature\u0026rsquo;s creation!\n10:30hrs. Sandeep declares he\u0026rsquo;s not going to walk a bit further because of his ligament problem. By the banks, we notice a bullock cart. Rajyam enquires the villager if he would fancy riding us back to the spot where the car was parked. An outright No comes as the answer. At this juncture, Rajyam states if one of us could get back with him, he could guide us to get the vehicle to a spot pretty close to the river bed. Anirudh and I decide to take it on and follow Rajyam. Sandeep and Amit rest in the shade. The hike back gets more gruelling with the heat taking its toll. We\u0026rsquo;re left with no water.Two hours and we still do not seem to reach the spot. Anirudh seems to be in a precarious situation and is in no position to move ahead. Finally sense prevails and we ask him to rest in a spot which looked safe. Rajyam and I rush to the car and thankfully this happens to be only about a 10mins quick walk from that place. We pull out a waterbottle and two apples and rush back to the spot where we\u0026rsquo;d left Anirudh. He thankfully is very much alert and the water and apples revives him a bit.Boy. Those were the juiciest apples I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had till date! With some motivation the three of us fnally reach the car at around 13:00hrs. These folks had thankfully about 10lts of water in the car. We gulp down liters and finally start driving our way to the river bed to pick up the other two. Rajyam states it would take us easily about twenty minutes to reach the spot. We\u0026rsquo;re a bit worried about them as its almost been close to three hours that we\u0026rsquo;ve left them and they themselves are left with no water. The only consolidation was that they were in the shade and had some watersource nearby to bank on if it really comes to it.\nAfter a tough ride through narrow paths , we reach a spot where we get to see the river to our right. We\u0026rsquo;re just a few yards away from the spot where the other two were left when we realise the vehicle could not move ahead because of the terrain. I walk down to the riverbed with a bottle of cold water but am compelled to get back as they\u0026rsquo;re not to be seen there. As I get back I see the vehicle in a real bad state. Anirudh had asked Rajyam to guide him down the path hoping to bypass the big stone that was in the middle but due to some miscommunication the stone got under the chassis and was literally pivoting it. Despite several attempts to inch it out, the Dicor refuses to budge. Anirudh revs up the Dicor\u0026rsquo;s engine one last time to get the huge stone that\u0026rsquo;s stuck beneath the chassis.

Scorching 45 degrees outside.No sleep, no breakfast; Five hours of non-stop walk in the highly de-forested wildlife sanctuary, a dried up river bed on the right and two highly dehydrated people from the team yet to make their way to the car. Anirudh swings the car\u0026rsquo;s door open, hurls himself to the drivers seat, switches on the AC and drifts into oblivion. I follow suit. We request Rajyam to fetch the other two to the car.\nAfter about half an hour, the three of them return. The look on their faces said it all! Later we get to know some grateful guy had created a fresh water spring on the river bed for them and that is what kept them going till this moment. They relax for sometime and finally at about 14:00hrs we decide to give the vehicle another shot again. With some more trials the stone beneath the chassis is finally removed. The happiness is pretty shortlived as the vehicle soon gets caught up in the loose gravel. The vehicle refused to budge and was only sinking more deep in the soil. All attempts to harden the ground by placing rocks and stones in the gaps only led to the Dicor getting badly damaged from the bottom. For close to two hours in the scathing sun we try our best in getting the vehicle out. Turn by turn finally at around 16:30hrs the vehicle budges out. Avoiding any more delay we outrightly move out of this place all covered in dust and dirt.\nWe drop Rajyam in his village and decide to head to Nirmal. 17:45hrs we reach Nirmal. I decide to call it a day and head to Hyderabad while the remaining three head to a hotel to clean up and crash. I board an inter district local bus at about 18:00hrs. With a drunkard for company and five hours of \u0026lsquo;rocking\u0026rsquo; travel I finally reach Hyderabad at about 23:30hrs.\nThe wild boar, the sambhars, trails of pugmarks, scat samples, the agonising hike in the blistering heat, miserably stuck Dicor, the drunkard in the local bus and the five hour long ride \u0026hellip;was it all worth it? Hell, it was! Been quite some time that I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced such a LONG day. I\u0026rsquo;ve literally lived every second of it! And boy, I\u0026rsquo;m still rich with two more days to spend on other things!\nMisc Details:\nDistance from Hyderabad: About 270kms [~50kms from Mancherial Railway station ]. Take a left at Lakshettipett and drive straight down to Jannaram. Wikimapia link HYTICOS has been successful in blocking civilian movement from 00:00 hrs to 06:00hrs on the road connecting Jannaram and Nirmal that passes through the WLS. Tiger estimation using Pugmarks:\nThe Pugmark methodology for estimating tigers may not really be scientific but still looks to be pretty convincing on paper. Here\u0026rsquo;s an interesting link to understand how this thing works. As far as my understanding goes, tiger estimation in this region is done using pugmarks alone. But looking at the way it was being practised at KWS I fail to understand how close to the actual figures our estimates would be No heed was being paid to check if the impression was of the hind leg or the front leg. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t photographs alone do? Why would you want to trace out the pugmark on a glass surface and then on to the sheet? Agreed this method has been in use for a long time now. But I strongly believe with use of technology a much better concrete exercise can be pulled out.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2009/05/02/kawal-wildlife-sanctuary-the-moron-vs.-the-wild/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAnirudh revs up the Dicor\u0026rsquo;s engine one last time to get the huge stone that\u0026rsquo;s stuck beneath the chassis.

The topic in hand, the lucid language, Intertwining of mountaineering and his mammoth project - I\u0026rsquo;m not sure which of these made it that gripping.\nThe first chapter scales you up the K2 in Mortenson\u0026rsquo;s shoes and as you read through, you\u0026rsquo;re literally made to experience his struggle for survival on the towering peaks. Touched by the hospitality shown by the villagers he makes a promise to change their lives for good. That one promise urges him to start on a project which gains mammoth proportions as time flies by. Through the chapters Relin, the co-author, dramatically brings about how Mortenson works against the wind to setup schools for Kids in villages in Pakistan that have been left untouched by any aspects of the modern world. The last few chapters brilliantly describe how important child education is and how it could be used as a powerful and detrimental factor in combating terrorism.\nReading at times gets you thinking on things much more important that what we keep doing to earn that morsel and secure our future.

At 60+, fired by a person whom he himself had recommended, Michael walks you through his life as he miserably tumults down from the post of a Creative director at an advertising firm JWT. Exposed to the elite corporate lifestyle for 25+ years he brings out the mental stress he passes through having to work in a Starbucks store as a bartender. He soon learns to come to terms with life; learns to let go of his ego and finally builds up a ripe career at Starbucks. Working at Starbucks in the lower rungs of the hierarchial ladder he lucidly brings out what the real sense of Job satisfaction is and how important it is to respect the job you do however menial it is.\nA perfect five on five! If you´ve still not read this book\u0026hellip;High time you order!\nGo Kiss the world - Subroto Bagchi\nHappened to purchase this book from the Strand store just out of impulse. A quick simple read. One of those books that surprisingly got over in a couple of hours. Give´s you insight into how Mindtree was born and how they shaped up. One stark feature of this book is that though each chapter is good in its own sense, there seems to be no continuity in the flow. Wouldn´t really fall into the autobiography groove - Probably a mix of history and gyan. That said you may want to give it a shot\nI would give it a 3.5 on a five point scale.\nScoop from the greener side:\nRegistered for the Jalori pass - National Himalayan Mountain Biking Expedition 2009 Off to Kulu - Manali - Aut in May - Yippee!Would be byking with 19 other unknown morons for 8 straight days.

We´re half way up the first stage and my cell beeps with a message - ´Debi has a fatal fall. Critical. Call ASAP´. Limited network on the hillock just does not allow the call to fall through. Debashish and a couple of his friends had been to Kerala and were scaling down the Chembra peak that Saturday.evening.We´d just started hiking up Kalsubai. I had met Debi,Roy, Manas and Rahul during one of my regular visits to Hyderabad when I was posted in Pune. They were then backpacking and exploring little known places in the country during their break. A down to earth group and you could easily fall in sync. with them in minutes. Last week Debi called me asking for places to visit in Kerala and I suggested Chembra peak. Little did I know how drastic a turn this would be for them.\nFinally at about 19:10hrs I´m able to get the line across to Roy. All that comes from the other end is mumbled talk of what happened.Apparently Debi had lost control while moving downhill, stumbled over a rough patch. and had a scary fall downhill. Sparse medical help was available only after three hours. With major bruises there was very limited scope. Next day 06:25hrs he breathes his last. As the message sinks in, I happen to recollect how unpredictable life is. I´ve always believed nature gives you a second chance. Today I´ve learnt - everything in life has exceptions. May his soul rest in peace.\nPost this incident, The Kalsubai trek is not something that I would like to remember but to stick to the ground rule that I would document each and every important event happening in my life, Here it goes.\n18 of us from Hyderabad, 12 from Pune and 1 from Mumbai finally decide to head to scale the Kalsubai Peak. I was looking forward to this trek for many reasons - This would be my last trek for some time to come, This would probably be my last visit to Pune and oh yes, Kalsubai is the highest peak in Maharashtra. The Hyderabad team reaches Pune at about 08:00hrs.We board the TT that was arranged by the Pune team and head towards Nasik Phata where we meet them. A brief stop over for lunch at Sangammner and we proceed to Bari.\nAt about 17:30hrs we start the trek. The first patch seems to be pretty much a simple hike.We reach a plateau in about half an hour. A villager dwelling in a small hut there provides some lemon juice. The weather starts cooling down and in moments you get to smell the fresh smell of rain water seeping into barren soil. And then, comes in the message from Roy. I seem to loose my balance of mind and stop registering all that´s happening around me.For the next one hour or so it´s a somber trek up the peak. I try to maintain my calm by venting all my anger on people who were slow. For the first time ever, I fail miserably in handling my responsibility as a sweep.The hailstorm sets in and it´s almost 19:30 hrs by the time we reach the penultimate plateau.Thankfully the team decides to stay put in the shack there. It gets cold as night sets in.. 31 of us huddle in a 10x20ft shack. Thanks to Bani, we have a tarpaulin sheet to protect us from the hailstorm. In about an hour or so the hailstorm stops. Few folks head up to the peak while the remaining huddle in the shack. I try in vain to distract myself but end up having a quick dinner and crash on the floor. Later, next day morning at about 05:00am, I´m woken up by someone and only then do I realise I´ve slept six hours flat like a log when not one of the remaining 30 people have managed to shut their eyelids in the freezing cold.\nRoy´s final news at 06:30 gets on me and I loose my cool once again. I decide to reach the base as early as possible.We reach the base village by 07:30am. The Pune folks decide to head to Bhandardara dam while we head to Pune as we´d to board the Hyderbad exp. scheduled to depart from Pune at 16:30 hrs.We manage to reach well before time and by 05:00hrs next day morning we´re back at hyd.\nI´m not someone to fall in for lame superstitions. But this time, Friday the 13th does not seem to have been any favorable to me. I´d better stop misconstruing things and kick back to normalcy.\nDetails:\nTeam: 31\nRoute: Pune - Nashik Phata-Chakan-Narayan Gaon-Ale Phata-Sangamner-Akole-Rajur-Bari\nDistance: Pune-Sangammner:~140kms; Sangammner-Rajur:~36kms; Rajur-Bari:~15kms\nAltitude: ~5400ft. above MSL.\nEndurance: Med. | Difficulty : low [Non Monsoon] Med [Monsoon] .

We careen round the corner and happen to sight a couple of lorry drivers gambling on the roadside by the moonlight. Mallik and I park the bikes and venture ahead to enquire how far we were from Thangaon. 18Kms is what we get in response. Almost instantaneously I spurt out - Give it a damn! I lose my patience and decide to quit. Quit a race that I\u0026rsquo;ve been mentally preparing for close to three months now. I believe in my instincts and truly live by it!Another look at Mallik and Trupti only reconfirms the decision - I was not alone.\nWe decide to move a bit ahead to a safer place, pedal uphill, take a left and glide down the hill. A bit ahead to the left, the rays from my head lamp happens to cause the Enduro vest of another cyclist shimmer. As we slow down we see a lady lying by the corner. A quick glance at him and he lets us know that she was finding it difficult to breathe and their third team mate had left about half an hour back to Thangaon in search of medical help. All attempts to contact the marshals out there was futile.This only strengthens our decision to leave the Enduro3-09 book open this time. Endurance is something you need to test at some point of time in life - But when you realise the odds are simply illogical and you could end up losing something more vital, you\u0026rsquo;ll know you don\u0026rsquo;t have to prove to some third person how high a bar you can jump.\nThat said, let\u0026rsquo;s move over to the rosier aspects of the race.\n06:30 hrs. The pre-race registration begins at the University of Pune grounds. As we reach the grounds, we get to hear the Silver rock band tuning their equipment. Soon, the team leads are requested to report their teams and collect the vests, directions brochure and trash bags.As we adorn the vests and try demystifying the understandably abstract Google satellite maps, teams still scoop in to the grounds with Hercules, Atlas, Firefox, Merida\u0026rsquo;s and Trek\u0026rsquo;s. You won\u0026rsquo;t believe one lad had actually re-modelled an Atlas basic bike to sport derailleur and gears! In about an hour the vast ground is all vibrant with participants, marshals, organisers and people who\u0026rsquo;d come to cheer their peers. The \u0026lsquo;Silver\u0026rsquo; band delivers a pumping performance followed by a random introductory call by the organisers. Meanwhile the teams are spread out on the ground categorically and at about 09:30 hrs. Enduro3-09 is given a flag off. It\u0026rsquo;s a tremendous feeling to witness the swarm of bikes flushing out of the podium.What with high bass rock songs being doled out as each category rolled out of the grounds. Man, You really need to be there to experience it!\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_266\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;300\u0026rdquo; caption=\u0026ldquo;07 Feb'09 Early hours - Prior to flag-off\u0026rdquo;][/caption]\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_267\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;300\u0026rdquo; caption=\u0026ldquo;Gearing up for the ride \u0026ldquo;][/caption]\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_268\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;300\u0026rdquo; caption=\u0026ldquo;Performance by Silver band - Prior to flag-off\u0026rdquo;][/caption]\nThe Warm-up ride\nThe first 10kms was a warm up ride from the University of Pune to the NDA campus [ Chandini Chowk]. In minutes, Pune roads are taken over by the red wave. Heavy vehicular movement literally comes to a standstill and paths are made to give us a free way. Knowingly or unknowingly, the city succumbs to the green drive! At about 10:15hrs we reach Chandani Chowk.\nWell, even roses wilt on the Table top\nClose to Garden court is where the first \u0026lsquo;Time Check\u0026rsquo; -TC begins. Right at the moment when you think all is good, the dirt track begins. Prior to the race, I had this mindset that 80 percent of the roads that we were supposed to ride on, would be proper tar roads and that \u0026lsquo;dirt tracks\u0026rsquo; was only for a short patch. Little did I know, this was just the beginning. A little before the NDA main gate we\u0026rsquo;re directed to take a left to the dirt patch. The first few minutes are rocking moments. Fifteen minutes into this and soon you get to know what really rocking is! With the mercury rising and you\u0026rsquo;re ass rising equivalently on the saddle, only time reasons out why you have that splitting head ache. The trail goes on for about half an hour and finally we reach the NDA Polo grounds passing through Table top and covering a few checkpoints.\nWish we were in the Amateur category!\nThe next section of the race was \u0026lsquo;called\u0026rsquo; Orienteering. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to follow the instructions, navigate using a compass and traverse through the hills, reach a specified point and then get back to the start point. All I can comment on this section is that is was a perfectly illogical, purposeless. What sense does it make to trek in the hot sun with no specific goal? In about an hour or so we reach the start point totally exhausted. The guys in the amateur category on the other hand were asked to do paddling at Peacock Bay!\nDone with the \u0026lsquo;Orienteering\u0026rsquo; we then are directed to head towards Neelkanteshwar Phata touching Peacock Bay, Khadakwadi and Mandvi.Thankfully, you get to fill your bottles with water at Peacock bay. All through the way, you get to see people popping off their bikes and crashing on the ground.Just round the corner yet another team stops over to mend their bikes, the Photographers tag behind to capture pain and emotions. It\u0026rsquo;s all a silent solemn ride. At about 17:05hrs we reach PC3.From here we\u0026rsquo;re directed to reach Kuran fork. This stretch is a mix of flats and slopes. Another two hours of silent struggle through Dawje, Kuran Budruk, Varasgaon dam and we finally reach TC4.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s 19:05hrs and we\u0026rsquo;re almost ripped out. At the TC4 check point a cheerful marshal comes across and gives us directions to the last checkpoint for the cycling section. Just 18 more kms is what she says. Ride straight, keep to your right - few more kilometeres again take a right and soon you should reach Thangaon. \u0026lsquo;How bad are the roads?\u0026rsquo; one of us sarcastically asks and to our timed relief she responds saying - \u0026lsquo;Pretty good. Just flats!\u0026rsquo;.\nAt 19:30 hrs we start riding towards Thangaon. The purported 18kms remains an elusive magical number. A few people that we get to meet en-route tell us we\u0026rsquo;re still 25kms away and to add fuel to fire, we get to know roads are very much under construction and they\u0026rsquo;re in a pretty bad state now. Everty turn round the corner leads you to just another uphill and the gradient always seems to be on the positive side. To add to all this the road construction work brings about a totally different terrain. All you\u0026rsquo;re left to do is to push your bike up the gradients! It\u0026rsquo;s damn chilly out here and every breath you take in brings out just another sore cough. We careen round the corner and happen to sight a couple of lorry drivers gambling on the roadside by the moonlight. Mallik and I park the bikes and venture ahead to enquire how far we were from Thangaon. 18Kms is what we get in response. Almost instantaneously I spurt out - Give it a damn! I lose my patience and decide to quit. Quit a race that I\u0026rsquo;ve been mentally preparing for close to three months now. I believe in my instincts and truly live by it! Another look at Mallik and Trupti only reconfirms the decision - I was not alone. At about 23:30 hrs we take the bait. It just didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to continue. Ideally we were supposed to reach TC5 [ Thangaon ] at least by 00:00hrs and complete the second orienteering section by 02:00hrs to remain qualified. We still had a very good chance of being in the race had we pushed a bit more. But the decision was taken considering several factors and it was best to enjoy the remaining part of the race at least.In this mad rush for the past twelve hours or so all we\u0026rsquo;ve done was to pedal madly on the roads without giving much interest to the ambience around. Only during the early hours of 8th Feb do we really take in the environs! A quick dinner(?) and we crash in our sleeping bags in one corner of the road.\nThe alarm hoots at 01:00am. We\u0026rsquo;d to reach the base camp by 04:00am. 18more kms to go and all that keeps us moving ahead is the fear that we may have to ride our bikes back to Pune if we happen to reach late. Just about five kms before reaching Thangaon, we take it easy and catch another nap for an hour or so. Finally at about 06:00hrs we reach Thangaon base camp. Enduro3 09 ends here for us.We leave the Thangaon base camp by the only available state transport bus at about 07:30hrs. Guess this was the only day in the whole year when the bus was filled beyond its capacity! But for a few smiling faces here and there, all you get to see is blood shot eyed faces and idle minds wondering on the day that was yesterday.As the bus winds back through the same route that we cycled, we still see teams still pushing their bikes up the slopes trying to reach the basecamp, teams lying on the sides catching sleep.\nOn the other hand, a few of the teams had already started the trekking post the night orienteering. Later we get to know they had to hike for about 12hrs, followed by a river crossing and a final sprint of about 40kms to reach the final destination. Two other infy teams - Team Vagabonds [Prawaal, Bani and Revathi] and Team Punctured [NIshant, Pankaj and Nikita] commendably complete the race. Team Punctured lose the second runners up to Team Vagabonds by a whisker of just about three minutes. All said, hats off to their mental endurance! And if this is for just the IT category folks, wonder what act of obeisance would the Open category folks call for!\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_269\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;300\u0026rdquo; caption=\u0026ldquo;Team Vagabonds on the podium\u0026rdquo;][/caption]\nA few things that I guess the Enduro3 committee needs to keep in mind while organising the event next year.\nPurandare. Thanks for anchoring this wonderful race but Chill! Out here everyone seems to be talking of your brusque attitude.I\u0026rsquo;ve not met you in person but that\u0026rsquo;s the image I\u0026rsquo;ve got! The Enduro3 website for the most part of it does not hold any information on the race details. For people who participate from outstation the dependency is pretty high! Not everyone who participates in the race is a super-human. Medical help or emergency action posts need to be setup at least every five kilometeres. Agreed, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of overhead but at least radio contact can be arranged!I myself have come across two incidents when people needed help and would have been well off had they got it a bit earlier. Guys, I sincerely wonder if the marshals were asked to give wrong stats on the path and distance just to motivate people. If so, we\u0026rsquo;re highly mistaken. Details such as this just cannot be manipulated. Thankgaon-18Kms, flat, good condition roads? GIve me a break! Knowing one\u0026rsquo;s goal point is much of a necessity and all are not knowledgeable enough to judge distances based on the google maps provided. Agreed Enduro3 is all about endurance testing. But what if a team is miserably down and does not have water? Ah, for cyclists Treks, Meridas, Firefox, Hercules and Atlas are much more valuable than BMWs, Rolls Royce and Mercs. You just cannot pile the bikes as in a scrap van when getting them back from Thangaon to Pune.Gosh, a few folks would have spent 20 and 30 grand on them. Theses bikes DEMAND respect. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t you have brought them more humanly? [Let me see if I can get my friend to send across the picture of the transport truck that he had taken.] Teams which have completed the race deserve to be given credit. This year the only differentiating factor between a team that had participated and completed the race was a single strike on the certificate.And oh , Yes. They didn\u0026rsquo;t even have their names written on them! Next year if you need some help in filling the forms, call in a few more participants to help you out with the certificates. We\u0026rsquo;ll be all the more happy to show our respect for them! And a few things commendable about the event this year:\nAwesome flag off ceremony! The red wave on Pune city roads caught quite a few surprised. Cool night reflector caps and vests. You marshals deserve a heartfelt thanks for those motivating words.[ Probably it was we who construed them wrong :) ] All in all, it was a tremendous experience. Enduro3-09 has taught me to defy the saying - Never Quit! and equate it to - \u0026lsquo;Weigh your options!\u0026rsquo; and I\u0026rsquo;m sure when I hit for Enduro3-\u0026lsquo;10 I\u0026rsquo;ll be a sharpened diamond with this years experience!\nAll pics courtesy: Ayush [Team SubZero ]\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2009/02/14/enduro3-09/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e07th Feb.- Saturday 23:25hrs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s damn chilly out here and every breath you take in brings out just another sore cough.

We leave at 06:12 hrs from here and head towards Afzalgunj through Chaderghat. Heavy vehicular traffic at the Imlibun bus stand delays us and we finally reach Charminar at about 06:40am. Boy, I never knew Charminar was so close to my place!\nRiding through the narrow roads that lead to the monument at early hours gives you a heavenly feeling. Indeed interesting to see the city come to life here -Newspaper hawkers stacking up the sheets, tea-shops brimming with activity, people walking over to the masjid for namaz, beggars setting up their sheets, an old couple hastening up their pace for some unknown emergency, the smell of Athar slowly sinking in, the orange hue slowly setting in to usher in just another day across the most prominent symbol of Hyderabad.\n07:12 hrs, after a few photo shots we decide to leave and head back home. Riding back through the old city roads via the High court, Moazzam Jahi market, Lal Bahadur Stadium, Liberty junction and finally touching HImayatnagar we reach Vidyanagar at about 07:35 hrs. Three cups of Irani chai at the roadside \u0026lsquo;chai\u0026rsquo; shop and I head back to Habsiguda.\nThis I guess would be my last long ride before I head to Pune on 5th Feb for Enduro3.

Bani says that would equate to 100kms on a high end bike and that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m banking on for confidence.\nBack there in Pune, the teams in Pune [ at least, those I know of ] have been training for this event like crazy.

The plan was to head towards Qutub shahi tombs - Towlichowki, touching Necklace road en-route. Adi was to join me at Fever hospital. I place him a call before I kick off and then head towards Vidyanagar. By 06:05am I reach Adi\u0026rsquo;s residence.A brief stop over at his place and we leave at about 06:30am from his house. As we slowly pick up pace, the consistently rising whizzing sound of the spokes cutting across thin breeze as we speed up-slope acts as just another motivating factor. Pedalling through Fever hospital, Himayatnagar, lower tank bund, Prasad\u0026rsquo;s we reach Necklace road at about 06:50am.\nA bit ahead of EatStreet we park our bikes on the footpath and Adi gets out his D60. For ten whole minutes he\u0026rsquo;s busy focussing and capturing the rising beauty of the city. At 07:10am we decide to leave and push over to our respective destinations. Adi had to head back home and I to Qutub Shahi. As we near the Imax circle, to the left we notice a group of people with Infosys badges. It takes a while for me to recollect that there was this rally that was jointly being organised by the ECO club in Infy and the IYCN today morning at 06:30am. We turn around and have a quick chat with the folks out there. There\u0026rsquo;s a change in plan almost instantly and we join the rally.\nThe central idea of the rally was to move in a group and spread word of ecologically friendly ways of commuting. The ICYN team join on their Revas in a few minutes.A set of school students join the group and the rally kicks start. Adi and I move with the group initially but not able to match the slow pace in which they were moving speed across on the road to the destination point of the rally - Sanjeevaiah park. The team takes close to twenty minutes to reach the park.A quick breakfast there and we have a set of games.\nOne thing about the IYCN rally was that, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it really served the purpose. Though their concept of the road tour was unquestionably reasonable, the rally I guess didn\u0026rsquo;t drive home the point. 07:30 hrs in the morning on a Weekend expecting to cut across a message to the public is definitely tad bit difficult and logically unreasonable.. Besides, instead of covering the Tank bund stretch we should have headed to the internal roads so as to reach out to more people. Anyway, That\u0026rsquo;s just a take away from the first meet.\nAt 09:45 hrs, I decide to head back home as I had to sort out a few isues with my Axis account. I take a U turn and pedal back towards Ranigunj.Touching Patny, Paradise, St. Ann\u0026rsquo;s, Sangeet X roads and finally Taranaka I reach Habsiguda at about 11:00hrs.\nAll in all, it was a cool but tiring ride back for some reason.Distance covered would approximately be around 30-35kms.But given the frequency of breaks and the time taken there\u0026rsquo;s one thing I need to work up on - Building my stamina. Most importantly keeping myself mentally prepared for long rides.

Losing sleep over Irodov, Resnick and Halliday, Sarin and Sarin just to win that extra mark in an examination given by the so called \u0026lsquo;Cream academia\u0026rsquo; of India. I was running a race, a marathon in fact and suddenly somewhere at the fag end, I realise I was blindfolded and was only following the bandwagon. A honk of the 3k gets me back to my senses and I hop into the bus. Waking up early and getting things on the string is no more an issue.

We have a brief stop over at a filling station about 40 minutes into the ride and then head directly to the destination. Roads for the most part of it are tarred and you have a comfortable ride almost all through the complete stretch.\nWe reach the Bidar city outskirts by around 10:00 hrs. We first head to the Choubara [ Watch tower ] and from there proceed to the Mehmood Gawan Madarsa. Just as many of the monuments in Bidar, the madarsa is now ASI protected. Not much remains of the building, but what is left by itself outrageously talks of the historical prominence. Classes are still conducted in a section of the Madarsa that faces the road. We then head to the Bidar fort. Purported to date back to the 8th century this massive fort, now in ruins still has an aura of power emanating from its barren grounds. With not many visitors in this area , You feel totally lost and at the same time surprisingly comfortable walking along the Burjs. A museum in the fort contours maintained exceptionally well by the government boasts of the history and the life of the Bahamanian people and their ancestors. Gardens are maintain beautifully well in complete persian style and they don\u0026rsquo;t charge you a dime for entrance! Hats off to the ASI!\nAfter exploring a few more areas of the fort we head to the Guru Nanak Jhira Gurudwara. We spend some quality time here by the Amrit Khund after a decent lunch at the langar [free kitchen] and then head to the Narasimha Zarna temple. This is believed to be the only Narsimha temple in south India and one is supposed to wade through 350mts of chest deep water in a cave infested with harmless bats and cockroaches to reach the sanctum sanctorum :-) . Though quite a few arrangements like lighting and air duct ventilation has been provided, there\u0026rsquo;s still scope for a lot of development here. The entrance to the temple is badly maintained and very little care has been taken to keep it clean. With no regulation really in place and the huge crowd coming, it\u0026rsquo;s a pity a place of worship such as this is in such a bad state of affairs.\nWe leave from Bidar at about 16:20 hrs targetting to reach the Hyderabad city outskirts at least by 6:30pm. An awesome ride with the speedometer notching 100kmph at times on the highway and the thrill of riding in a group gets us to the city skirts BHEL by around 19:00hrs. It\u0026rsquo;s close to 21:00hrs by the time I reach home. Close to 320 kms on the bike, heavy traffic once in the city limits finally takes its toll and I crash on the bed, the moment I reach home and have dinner.\nPhotos courtesy: Animesh Kumar Hazra - [http://picasaweb.google.com/trulyani/Bidar#]\nInteresting links on Bidar\nThe Tribune Kaladarshana ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2009/01/04/the-bidar-ride/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"03-jan-08\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e03-Jan-08\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e04:30hrs  - After a quick jog,  as I stand at the APSRTC bus stand in Tarnaka, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the two years I effectively wasted preparing for the IITs. This was the place where my brother and I used to board the bus to reach Vidyanagar for the morning classes. Every day spent trying to learn concepts with no real implication on my life. Losing sleep over Irodov, Resnick and Halliday, Sarin and Sarin just to win that extra mark in an examination given by the so called \u0026lsquo;Cream academia\u0026rsquo; of India. I was running a race, a marathon in fact and suddenly somewhere at the fag end, I realise I was blindfolded and was only following the bandwagon. A honk of the 3k gets me back to my senses and I hop into the bus. Waking up early and getting things on the string is no more an issue. That\u0026rsquo;s the only thing I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from two years of IIT preparation. And I\u0026rsquo;ve no regrets!\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Bidar ride"},{"content":"Mudit spreads out a sheet of paper on the table right in front of CCD. FIve more heads hustle over the fine print and in a few moments HydVentura\u0026rsquo;s next flagpost is decided. A trip was long pending and we could just not let the four day Christmas weekend to go by just like that! Animesh floats a mail across to the internal group the very next day followed by a formal communication mail from Shiva. In a few days for the first time ever we\u0026rsquo;re flooded with nominations for the trip. 45 and odd people respond in positive. We\u0026rsquo;re compelled to raise the bar and send out another mailer stating that only people who\u0026rsquo;ve transferred the requisite amount before friday EOD would be considered. Nominations are finally frozen by next monday EOD.Amidst tight schedules arrangements are parallely taken care of and by 21st december we\u0026rsquo;re almost good to head for the trek. Accommodation, Travel and other miscellaneous arrangements almost seem to fall in place.\nThe first mailer that was sent out had the difficulty and endurance of the trek set at \u0026lsquo;medium\u0026rsquo;. But as days pass and as information is gathered, the group is apprised of the difficulty. The ratio surprisingly seems to fall on the heavier side. With last minute drop-outs and substitute replacements, 24th morning has the count at 15 ladies and 13 guys. Later into the trip we would realise HydVentura has spread its wings to IBM and MIcrosoft!\n24th December\u0026rsquo; 08 - Wednesday\nDeepa calls and informs she\u0026rsquo;s compelled to quit. Shefy, Poorvi, Sravanti and I leave from the Microsoft campus at around 16:50hrs. Sookti joins us at MGBS by around 18:25hrs. We sell Deepa\u0026rsquo;s ticket to another person and soon happen to meet the 20:30 service folks too.The 19:30 Garuda service pulls into the station at around 19:50hrs we\u0026rsquo;re honking out of Hyderabad. Jiddu, Sadique, Aish, Anu, Ajay, Hari, Swati, Revathi,Himanshu,Bhavya,Divya,Jeevz, Prasanna and Poorna leave by the 20:30hrs service. Eby and Madhuri were to leave by train and would be joining us the next day at Yaatri NIvas, Bangalore the next day along with Shruti, Atul, Sashank and Manoj [Joining from B\u0026rsquo;lore] and Rachesh Nambiar [ joining from Chennai ]. Ram would be joining us directly at Sulthan Bathery the next day. The long day takes its toll and the onward jorney is more or less sober with not much happening.\n25th December\u0026rsquo; 08 - Thursday\nAt about 06:40 hrs the bus we\u0026rsquo;re travelling breaks down about 13kms before Chickballapur. Just before we decide hopping onto a Buffalo van , an APSRTC luxury liner screeches to a halt in front of us. Five of us and a couple of others hop into it and by 08:10hrs we reach Yatri Nivas. Madhuri, Eby, Sasank, Rachesh, Shruti and Manoj reach there well before us. JIddu and team arrive more or less at the same time. For a petty 40Rs. we refresh here and by 09:30hrs we\u0026rsquo;re all set to head off towards Wayanad in the Mazda and Sumo that had been arranged. At about 12:40 hrs we decide to have a brunch and Rachesh suggests we head for a restaurant thats quite close to Wonderla. Once there we realised they offered a pathetic service to big groups and got out after a few minutes wait. A few minutes ahead we stop over at another seemingly decent place for what now became a lunch. The restaurant owner arranges food for us in a thatched shed. A quick lunch with spices of antics from the hungry morons gets back things on the roll.\nAs the Sumo winds up one of the hair pin bends on the highway, I get to sense a feeling of oneness when I see a foreigner jack hammering the pedals of his Trek bike. It takes just moments to recall that he must be one of those 52 cyclists who\u0026rsquo;d come down to Bangalore for the 7 day TFN ride. I more or less expected to come across these folks en-route and the sight of this person only rekindled my spirits to take part in Enduro3. There\u0026rsquo;s this special bonding that you develop with the sport and believe me, only a cyclist can relate to it!\nAt about 18:00hrs we happen to reach the Karnataka-Kerala RTA checkpost. Since the vehicles had only a state permit it takes a while for the drivers to get done with the formalities. The government purportedly scoops 3000Rs. for the Mazda and 800Rs. for the Sumo for a seven day permit to travel in the state. For all you know as cash goes under the table in the RTA tent out there, we spend some quality time in the adjacent thick vegetative growth. Finally at about 18:25hrs we manage to leave the checkpost and head towards Sulthan Bathery. Ram by this time already covers Pookote lake and heads towards Ambalavayal. Close to 19:30hrs we reach the Sulthan Bathery town. Anish directs us to the Italiya resorts and at about 20:00hrs we reach the resort. A left turn at the Ambalavayal [Kalagapara] junction when you\u0026rsquo;re on the NH212 driving towards Calicut from Mysore takes you towards Edakkal caves. Italiya resorts, the place where we\u0026rsquo;d arranged accommodation for the folks fell on this route.\nJose and Vinoy welcome us to the lodge and show us around the place where we\u0026rsquo;d be camping for the next three days. Though we\u0026rsquo;d specifically asked for seperate dorms for the ladies, a miscommunication between Anish and Jose leads to just one dormitory being arranged. 150Rs. for that A/C dorm was indeed costly but then it was the best we could arrange remotely. Dinner was yet to be cooked and it would be atleast 10:00pm by the time we would get to lay our hands on the food. As people quickly refresh, Ram and I head to a nearby bakery to get some light snacks to satiate our hunger. Christmas this year is celebrated by sharing plum cakes with twenty seven people whom you\u0026rsquo;ve met just days before! We have a quick dinner by 22:30hrs. The long journey takes its toll and by around 23:15 hrs most of us hit the bed.\n26th December\u0026rsquo; 08 – Friday\nAt about 04:00 hrs in the morning, Jiddu\u0026rsquo;s cell starts hooting. But for a few silent abuses that pass beneath the sheet, people get to their toes soon and by 07:00hrs almost everyone\u0026rsquo;s ready. Jose serves some black tea and by 08:00hrs we\u0026rsquo;re all set to head for Chembra peak. We get some stuff packed for lunch and head towards the peak.\nThe Chembra peak trek\nAt about 09:00hrs we manage to reach the base of Chembra peak. Permission is required to trek the peak and the charge for every ten members is 500Rs. Guides are readily available at the base. As decided the night before we split the team into three groups, each having a lead and a sweep. Shefy, Rachesh and Ajay were to lead the groups. Aish, Jiddu and I as in any trek take up sweep\u0026rsquo;s role.\nWith an altitude of approx 2100m , Chembra peak is the highest peak in Wayanad and is purportedly higher than the Mulayangiri peak [ Highest peak in Karnataka ]. As you climb up, you can starkly differentiate the seven stages in the peak. On the second stage you come across a beautiful heart shaped pond. The first two stages are decently steep and from then on the climb is more or less just like any other trek with a few interesting stretches here and there.\nAt the third stage as rest of the other folks take some rest, Jiddu, Sasank and I head to climb a small hillock a bit away. Wading through shoulder high blades of grass, chancing the next step not quite knowing what lays ahead or down beneath there and finally making it to the top of the hillock for that splendid view of the valley down there was indeed a rejuvenator. In a few more moments we join the group and proceed towards the other stages. At about 13:40hrs we finally make it to the peak. Aish happens to almost give up at the second stage and it takes Jiddu an additional hour to prod her up to the summit.\nA quick lunch up on the peak and we\u0026rsquo;re set to head back. At about 15:10hrs we decide to start our descent. Things don\u0026rsquo;t really look rosy and since most of the members were rookies to trekking the descent takes its toll. Those who\u0026rsquo;d reached a bit early stop over at the Heart pond and spend some quality time waiting for us. Picking up the non-biodegradable remains we head down taking turns to prod people downhill. It takes close to four and a half hours for the descent and by the time we head to the base, dusk breaks in and the last part of the trek gets a bit more interesting because of the darkness. Finally at about 19:30hrs we reach the parking lot.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s always this special moment that I cherish after every trek – The pain, the sense of accomplishment and not to mention the elation that you get to see on people\u0026rsquo;s faces at the fag end. When you\u0026rsquo;re organising a trek for a big group, you always have this dagger behind your back reminding you to keep alternate plans just in case someone is not able to keep up the pace or for that instance even move with the group.Not to be pessimistic but at times you start off wondering how many would really complete the trek. This group was in a way very different. Most of them were rookies with not much exposure to physical activities. But then they had the enthusiasm to cut it right across the center and give in their best. I would attribute the success of the Chembra peak trek primarily to the spirit of the twenty seven folks to gel in and see to it that they got through it till the end – together!\nWe finally reach the lodge at about 21:00hrs and after a quick dinner hit the bed.\n27th December\u0026rsquo; 08 – Saturday\nEddakkal caves\nWe leave for Edakkal caves by around 09:00am. Edakkal caves gets its name from the literal translation of Eddai[Gap] – kal [Rock]. These formations are said to date back to the 400BC and the carvings in it are believed to be etched out by the Kurumbars [ Wayanad tribals]. Entrance to the caves is at a nominal 10Rs. Per head. In a way the caves are quite different from the other regular caves that you get to see. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to crawl into the front opening and then climb up a set of stairs. From here you walk a bit ahead and then climb another flight of rickety stairs. To your right here you\u0026rsquo;d find the central part of the Edakkal caves- the pristine carvings.\nTo explore other parts of the caves you can climb a set of rocks up and then squeeze yourself through another set of rocks to finally get exposed to another open space. The climb here gets interesting with you having to climb up the rock with the support of a rope. You could easily climb up the rock with a good pair of shoes without much of support though. You could climb a bit more ahead and gain a further ascent of about 1000ft if you have that rat in your mind. Jiddu and I gave it a shot and climbed the ascent in about 10minutes flat. There are spots where you get shit scared and you literally curse yourself for having attempted it but then the sense of accomplishment that you get once you reach the peak is all worth it.\nSoochipera falls\nAt about 14:30hrs we head towards Kalpetta-Meppad for a fitting lunch and from there proceed to Soochipera waterfalls. We reach the falls at about 17:30hrs.The chilling water, the rock formations , the starkly distinct cuts in the rocks at the base of the falls and the pristine location of the falls befittingly rejuvenates you. We spend about an hour or so here and quickly head back to the vehicles.\nA camp fire was arranged back at a place close to the lodge. Despite the pathetic collection of songs the lodge guys had, we spend a couple of hours by the fire and head back to the lodge. Back in the lodge hell breaks loose as we celebrate Sasanks b\u0026rsquo;day.\n28th December\u0026rsquo; 08 - Sunday\nWe leave for Bangalore at about 08:00hrs. A quick breakfast en-route and we pull over at another restaurant for lunch. At about 14:40hrs we reach Ranganthittu bird sanctuary at Mysore. Some quality time here and at about 16:00hrs we head towards Bangalore. The return journey to Hyd was arranged in two different buses. We run a lottery to see who\u0026rsquo;d get to go in the 20:30 service. Anuradha, Swathi, Bhavya, Divya, Revathi, Jeevz ,Shefy,Ram,Himanshu and I board the first service and chug back to hyd. Manoj, Atul and Shruthi head back home from Kalasapalayam. Eby and Madhuri have a ball of a time chasing their volvo all the way from Anand rao circle to Indra nagar. Rachesh picks his 21:15 service back to Chennai while the remaining team boards the 22:30hrs service to hyd.\nAs it all came to an end, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the first meeting that the core committee had close to a month back. Then we were simply targetting a group 0f 10-15. As days passed the numbers only grew and finally despite having a few more lucrative options [ TFN and the Gokarna trek] we stuck to the Chembra trek. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much happy I did! Four whole days of carefree fun, thrill of being in a big group and co-ordinating efforts to make it happen - Its indeed been a wonderful break from routine life. Besides, this was the first trek for quite a few people and everything just fell in place to make it a memorable trip!

In split nano seconds it takes snapshots of the accident and the analytical part tries to figure out what the cause of the brutal fall could have been. Well, that was one good news. Not that I knew the reason why I was on the ground instead of on the saddle, but because I at least knew my head was safe! I was thinking, I was analysing and damn I was enjoying it - In fact relishing every moment of it!\nBack to my real holistic senses, I put up a smile on my face, rise from the ground and limp back to my bike and as I head back it looms on me why I had that heavenly experience. There was a ridge on the road about half foot wide at the end of the slope and the front wheel couldn\u0026rsquo;t just bypass it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a sense of pride when you fall down.

Every weekday I used to head to office planning how I\u0026rsquo;d best spend the day so as to enjoy that weekend to the fullest. For the most part of it , it was visiting a new place or raising the bar to do a better or higher grade trek. I was sure, there was always something different in store for me that coming weekend. That only pushed me harder to give my best at work during the weekdays so as to avoid any last minute goof ups. \u0026lsquo;You work two days a week and take rest the remaining five days\u0026rsquo; is what Anmol once commented on my passion for trekking. I now realise how true he was!\nOn the brighter side, There\u0026rsquo;re three important yet simple learnings that I\u0026rsquo;ve gained from my Pune experience -\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not how long you live that is important. It\u0026rsquo;s how well you live it is all that matters. Raise the bar every time you feel you\u0026rsquo;re succumbed by pressure. You\u0026rsquo;ll soon know there\u0026rsquo;s much more to gather than what\u0026rsquo;s on the ground. Have a passion and target acting on it every weekend, Your work life would soon fall in place. That ways you\u0026rsquo;ll end up doing justice to both your personal as well as professional goals! Gyan in practice:\nGot a 21 geared Lumala bike for close to 7 grand sometime back. Guess cycling would soon replace my passion for Trekking. Joined a few internal clubs at the Hyd DC. Hope they keep me working on weekdays ;-) . The Budokan Karate classes start from November 1st . Just confirmed my registration today. Learning the Guitar by myself. Not much progress made though. On the Professional front, I\u0026rsquo;ve got roped into an assignment that would involve more of SDLC process than technical stuff. And I\u0026rsquo;m lovin\u0026rsquo; every bit of it! Who said life was boring ? I take back my words :-) .\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/10/21/gyan-de-la-spiky/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been just one week that I\u0026rsquo;ve got back to Hyderabad after my six months stay at Pune and I\u0026rsquo;m still struggling to cope with boredom. My body\u0026rsquo;s sort of got so fine tuned to an active lifestyle that sitting in front of the computer once I\u0026rsquo;m back home is something that I\u0026rsquo;d last prefer to do. But then that is all that I\u0026rsquo;m left to do, at least till I chalk out a few plans to get myself to rebound again.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Gyan de la Spiky"},{"content":"Around 3:00am in the morning, a cup of hot masala tea by the roadside gives me just the required warmth to keep aloof the frigid weather. As I stare out onto the winding roads ideally focussing nowhere, just another smile spans across with the very thought that I\u0026rsquo;m not heading back to Hyderabad without accomplishing Ratangad.\nOct 2nd 2008\n12:30AM. Prashant and Parin get the Sumo to a grinding halt right in front of Cotton kings. Sourabh,Ashu and I hop into it while Vishal joins us a bit ahead. We pick up Rahul enroute Hinjewadi. Gourav joins us at Infy Phase II and finally we head for Sangammner after picking Trupti from Dange Chowk. It\u0026rsquo;s close to 01:30AM. It gets cold as we hit the highway and the speed of the vehicle helps not a bit. While Rahul, Vishal and Trupti try some stunts in the rear end, Gourav,Sourab, Ashu and I try catching some sleep in the mid seat. At about 03:00am somewhere about 50kms ahead of Sangammner, we happen to sight an old man sitting by the roadside selling tea on his push cart. As the aroma gets my nostrils quivering, my mind wanders somewhere else wondering at the hardships this old man had to undergo to make ends meet. For what other reason would anyone be selling tea at this untimely an hour?\nPaying him, we hurl back into the vehicle and head towards Sangammner. Soon we cross Sangammner and head towards Ratanwadi through Akole and Rajur. At about 06:30 am we touch Bandardaara. An hour or so from there through kutcha roads and we reach the base village of Ratangad - Ratanwadi. Ratanwadi as such is famous for a 1000year old Shiva temple called the Amriteshwar temple.\nIdeally you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t require help from the villagers if you\u0026rsquo;ve been to this place once before. But Just to be on the safer side we head to the peak with the help of Barku Kaka. Ratangad lies to the left of the Amriteshwar temple as you face it. The first fifteen minutes of the trek is pretty much a walk by the stream and at times a few subtle crosses across it. In about half an hour you\u0026rsquo;d be reaching the first plateau which would then give you a glimpse of the Ratangad peak with a cascade right ahead. Another half an hour trek up takes you to a bifurcation. Here\u0026rsquo;s where you need to be a bit careful. You\u0026rsquo;d be heading for Katrabai pass if you walk straight ahead and Ratangad if you take the other fork. About another thirty minutes of climb from here, gets you to the most renown spot of Ratangad - The hanging ladders. These two independent ladders take you up to the main entrance of the fort. After having done Bhimashankar, these seemed to be a cake walk. But then, could you ever trust to be in safe bounds if you were to climb rickety ladders that were hooked to rocks with just a couple of struts to bolster them :-) ?\nAt about 10:15am we reach the Ratangad peak. A quick breakfast in one of the caves and we then set out to explore the remnants of the erstwhile fort. The Ratangad fort gives you the one of the most beautiful views of the sahyadri valley. There\u0026rsquo;s one particulat spot from where you could get to see a couple of adjoining peaks. The very sight of the tremendous cliffs towering from the deep valley below is by itself so very rewarding! Ashu, Rahul, Gourav and I head a bit more ahead in our quest to capture the Sahyadri beauty from a higher point. Only half way through do we realise that we\u0026rsquo;ve been actually climbing the peak with the sole conviction of going up there, not even remotely bothered of how we\u0026rsquo;d head back downwards! The knee height grass was the only support we had to climb up the steep peak. Still undeterred we finally manage to reach the peak. A couple of minutes here gives you the supreme confidence of having scaled 4000ft. With only the grass to prevent us from plummeting down the cliff, the path downhill is covered pretty sheepishly :-) .\nAt about 01:20pm we finally decide to head back downhill to the base village. In approximately an hour and a quarter past it, we hit the base village. A quick quasi lunch here with whatever we\u0026rsquo;re left with and we head back to Pune. Parin was hell bent on visiting the Bhandardara dam. So we take the Shendi route and reach the dam at about 04:30pm. With dusk nearing, the climate too gets pretty comforting. Added to it, the dam full to the brim and water overflowing from the contours in brief spasms makes just a beautiful recipe to relieve all the stress that you would have accumulated over the week. A few quite moments is spent sitting on the dyke watching water lash by the walls and unleashing all that it has to show . Finally at about 05:15pm we head back towards Sangammner. After a brief snack break somewhere close to Sangammner we manage to reach Pune outskirts by around 10:00pm.\nAnd even before I get to absorb it, I realise we\u0026rsquo;ve just covered Ratangad. After the failed attempt to pursue this during the R-K-H trek and an unavoidable let go due to my project party last weekend, October 2nd just seemed to fall in place for Ratangad :-) .\nDetails:\nTeam: 9\nRoute: Pune - Nashik Phata-Chakan-Narayan Gaon-Sangamner-Akole-Rajur-Randha falls-Bhandardara-Ratanwadi-Ratangad\nDistance: Pune-Sangammner:~140kms; Sangammner-Bhandardara: ~60kms; Bhandardara-Ratanwadi: ~20kms;\nAltitude: ~4200ft. above MSL.\nEndurance: Med. | Difficulty : low [Non Monsoon] High [Monsoon]\nTime : Uphill: 2.0 hrs.

It\u0026rsquo;s a saturday morning and here I am sitting on a cushioned seat of a bus to a place called Ananda Valley for a team outing - A team consisting of only a handful people whom i\u0026rsquo;ve interacted with, the rest being from different clusters.

It\u0026rsquo;s a 110 acre pristine valley about 50kms on the Nashik Highway and has been built by people who\u0026rsquo;ve been there on those lands for the past seven generations. Very hospitable people and a great unwinding spot. We reached the place at about 09:15am and after a quick breakfast head for an eco-tour cum trekking. A set of team building games follow and I get to interact with people from other clusters too. Lunch at about 01:00pm is followed by a splendid magic show. At about 04:30pm the rain dance starts. This goes on till about 06:30pm and we head back home.\nThe magic show was indeed the icing on the cake. Tricks can be learnt, but the way the interest of the audience is maintained is something that the magician brought about extremely well. In case you plan to have a party or a get-together, you may want to consider contacting Sallu Shaim on 09823085309 or 09325501635 for a show.

They do not spend much. Also Japan exports far more than it imports. They have an annual trade surplus of over $100 billion, yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.\nAmericans save little. Also US import more than it exports. Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger. But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China, and even India. Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars. India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billions in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities. Japan\u0026rsquo;s stakes in US securities is in trillions.\nResult: The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world saves for the US, Americans spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, the countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter that is $2 billion a day to the US! Otherwise the US economy would go for a sick. So will the global economy. The result will be no different if US consumers begin consuming less.\nA Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US. The same is the case with India. We have invested in US over $50 billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India. Why the world is after US? The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income.\nThat the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year. The result: The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money. It\u0026rsquo;s like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from his shop. The customer will not buy; the shop won\u0026rsquo;t have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper financier.\nWho is America\u0026rsquo;s biggest shopkeeper financer? Japan of course. Yet it\u0026rsquo;s Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself. Reduced the savings rates, even charged the savers Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don\u0026rsquo;t change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillions, about three times the Indian GDP.\nThus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.Hence, what is the lesson? A nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend. Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US told that don\u0026rsquo;t wastefully save. Start spending, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put all nations on a growth curve. \u0026lsquo;Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.\u0026rsquo;\nBefore you follow this neo economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend. This is what US has successfully done in last few decades.\nSource: Email Forward\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/09/19/those-little-bucks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOne another interesting article!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Japanese save a lot.

For those few seconds, as you\u0026rsquo;re left with nothing but just sheer gut instincts to guide you through, you\u0026rsquo;re stupefied by the way Mother Nature whispers in your ears as to how important your life is! I guess at times, it does help to reason out how important that thin dividing line between life and death is!\nAug 30th\n4:13 am I get a call from Suhas. He\u0026rsquo;s right outside my door waiting for me to open it, just after his night shift work. Damn! Some people never change. Aditya gets ready for work while I hit the bed again trying to spruce out those few moments of sleep. At 4:30am the first wakeup call goes out to Rahul. This time for some reason he doesn\u0026rsquo;t pick the call even after about six or seven calls. I decide to leave it to him for some more time and get fresh in a few minutes. A few more timess I try in vain and then call up Trupti, assuming she\u0026rsquo;s already shifted to her new house which is close to his place. But then, things just don\u0026rsquo;t happen the way you\u0026rsquo;d like it to be! She still hasn\u0026rsquo;t shifted.\nAshu arrives at my place at about 05:10am. With no other option left, we decide to move ahead and reach ShivajiNagar station to board the 6:00am Sinhagad express to Karjat. Ashu and Suhas suggest we board the train at Khadki. As we head to pick a rick. I give Trupti on final call to decide on how we need to proceed. Her suggestion was that we\u0026rsquo;d decide that at the station. So Ashu and Suhas head to Khadki and I head to Shivaji Nagar. Vaijan, Trupti and Sourabh reach ShivajiNagar station well ahead of us and meet Prashant, Parin, Monica and Anshuman who\u0026rsquo;d already reached the station. Once I reach at about 05:50am, Trupti and I decide to head back to Kalewadi Phata and wake up Nair or at least see what\u0026rsquo;s been keeping him down for so long. Monica and Anshuman quit at the station for unknown reasons. Our plan was to try catching up with the remaining team at Khandas. Anup was to board at Pimpri and Aditya at Chinchwad.\nAt about 06:30am we reach Nair\u0026rsquo;s residence and despite several bangs on his door no one responds. Finally after about five minutes, one of Nair\u0026rsquo;s friends fearfully opens the door and lets us in. We rush into Nair\u0026rsquo;s room only to see him sound asleep. Boy! You must have seen the expression on his face as his friend woke him up - the startled look just buys out everything that we had! As we head to Swargate, We still wonder as to how he could have missed all our calls despite his cell being in the normal mode!\nAs there were no direct buses to Karjat, we board an ST to Khopoli at about 08:30am. The remaining team had already reached Karjat by then. At about 10:00am we reach Khopoli and from there we move ahead to Karjat phata. At about 11:30am we finally manage to head to Karjat from Karjat phata. At Karjat, Rahul speaks to a chap to drop us at Khandas. The deal is set for 400Rs. At about 12:45pm as we reach Khandas, this weird driver demands 200 more saying he was totally unaware of the 400 deal. We do try to put up a bit of resistance but then it\u0026rsquo;s always better to play safe when you\u0026rsquo;re not in you territory, so we end up paying a solid 600 bucks for the one hour ride. Big time looting!\nAs we head towards Shidi Ghat, Anup messages me the directions from the starting point. We had to take a left after a small culvert and then keep walking the path after we take a right turn as and when we get to see two wells. They\u0026rsquo;d been waiting for us for almost two hours now at a small stream ahead. As we walk towards the culvert seeking directions from the villagers, a stark reality looms ahead. Most of them without even volunteering to help, directly ask if we needed a guide. We out rightly reject it and keep walking based on gut instinct. Thankfully, we find a small shop where we ask for directions. The old man helps us out with pleasure in a jiffy and asks us to be cautious as Shidi ghat could be a bit dicey for first timers to this place. In about twenty minutes we finally manage to meet up with the remaining nine folks. It\u0026rsquo;s been a long long wait for them!\nThe ladder, the Stare, the Pull and the Jump!\nAt about 2:00pm we start moving ahead. The climb up Shidi ghat is pretty straight forward for the first sixty minutes or so. A few pulls on the calf muscles and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be finding it that difficult to tread up the hill. At about 03:15 pm we happen to meet Tukkaram, another villager. A few yards ahead and we realise how helpful he was. Right round the corner lay the first hurdle of Bhimashankar - a rickety metallic ladder that is supposed to take you up to another adjunct cliff. Though chances are highly remote that you\u0026rsquo;d miss your step here on the ladder rungs; midway through, as you climb up the sloping support the very look at the precipice below would definitely give you a few missed beats! Once you cover this span and move a bit ahead, the second daunting phase of Bhimashankar presents itself in all glory - In the same cliff, to move ahead you need to literally hook up with your fingers to the rock crevices and hang parallel to the rock for a few moments before you get a foothold on the rocks again a bit further ahead. Supporting your 65+ body weight with your fingers at a height of about 1000ft - The emotions on people\u0026rsquo;s faces as Tukkaram kaka helped us out through this spot would probably be the best Kodak moment of this trek! Ah, and then comes another close to vertical Aluminum ladder supported by freshly added bamboo supports. Just when you think you\u0026rsquo;re almost up there, the ladder starts its slant towards the right cliff. It takes a few moments to get your balance right and then when you finally reach the last rung of the ladder all it takes ;-) is just a mighty push on the slippery rocks to gain firm ground. Shidi Ghat ROCKS!!\nOne by one we finally manage to reach the first level of the climb - A wide plateau on which on which are banked four to five houses and Paddy fields. This is where Arun - a seven year lad comes and enquires if we need anything to drink? Not wanting to lose any time we plan to move ahead without any breaks. Even before we cross one of the fields, this chap runs home and gets a vessel filled to the brim with \u0026lsquo;Thak\u0026rsquo; - Buttermilk. Phew! Now that\u0026rsquo;s business. I\u0026rsquo;d bet a 100$ on someone who\u0026rsquo;d morally and whole heartedly not want to have that drink after all the climb and jumps :-) .\nOnce everyone\u0026rsquo;s rejuvenated themselves, we start moving uphill. At about five we reach the Shidi Ghat-Ganesh Ghat junction. This is the place where both the routes culminate to lead to Bhimashankar. Tukkaram kaka takes leave here and directs us to Bhimashankar. Probably Anup and Aditya would be the best people to describe the last level climb :-) . We literally had Rahul behind their back at every step prodding them to move faster and bucking them up. For the last half an hour all we hear was a soaring \u0026lsquo;Chal\u0026rsquo;- Keep Moving. Probably, Had Rahul known Anup\u0026rsquo;s been in Infy for close to six years now, things would have been different :-) . Around 6:00pm we reach a diversion. We randomly chose the one that went straight and moved ahead. A fifteen minutes climb and even before we realize, we’ve reached the Bhimashankar Peak. Wohoo! All that was left now was to find the temple / village.\nIn search of wildlife!\nAs we tread along the well laid path and look a few yards ahead, we just have gaping faces. For a few moments not one of us talks. We’re left spellbound by just another creation of Nature. It’s just clouds, breeze, sounds of birds chirping and you! At a height of about 3600ft as you sit silently on the edge of the cliff, with the chilling breeze whining across your ears what else could you ask? I’m lost in deep thought of things past, present and future. Flashes of incidents just whizz past and as you reciprocate to Nature with a smile on your face, another set of memories get frozen somewhere and etched out!\nDarkness finally gets us back and then when it looms on us that we still had to reach the village, we try scouting for directions. Rahul thankfully gets the line across to Bhavna who’d been here recently. Ah ! Surprise. We were actually walking towards the Bhimashankar Wildlife sanctuary. A few yards and we would be lost in the wildlife :-) . We finally head back and come to a place where diversions were found. Visibility was real low. With not much to believe on but sheer instincts we huddle together and head towards a path which seemed more convincing. Just then, a distant sound of a bell catches our attention. We tread in the direction of the sound and in a few moments we sight lights a bit ahead. The chime and people’s voices become much clearer. A turn round the corner and behold! We find the temple at a distance. In about five minutes we reach the village. We’re surprised looking at the village size. What we expected to see was a small temple and a few huts here and there. But what we saw was a total contrast – A well maintained temple with big huts and houses. The whole place was sort of commercialized -Thanks to the road route that you have to Bhimashankar!\nA quick darshan in the temple and a dinner at the adjacent restaurant and we are set to hit the bed. This is when we decide to explore the place a bit more. Rahul, Ashu, Suhas, Vaijan, Anup, Prashant and I head towards thick foliage with no destination planned as such, while the remaining stay put near the temple outskirts. The temple was to close at about 10:00pm so we could loiter around till then. After a dense path, we finally reach a wide open plateau. Just to make things interesting, we switch off all the torch lights and sit in a circle and while away time. The Amavasya night made things all the more interesting. Finally at about 09:25 pm we decide to head back to the temple. Rahul, Anup and I had earlier spoken to the temple security guards’ to let us sleep in the temple. He was fine with it but then later we got a better place in the adjacent durbar type stadium. A bit of cleaning and most of us hit the ground by 10:15pm. Sleeping mats and bags were scarce. So we had to spread out the bags on newspapers. Bedsheets were scarce too! Most of us spend the night shivering under the sparse bed sheets. A marvelous night spent listening to dog wails and human snores J .\nAug 31st\nThe alarm hoots at about 05:15am and I wake every sleeping soul in the team. It’s close to 06:30 by the time everyone finishes his obligatory duties and we decide to leave the stadium towards Ganesh ghat. We’d targeted the 4:00PM train to Pune from Karjat. Moving on those time lines we had to leave Bhimashankar by 07:00 am. Though we’d initially planned to re-visit the spot that we’d been to late last evening, it had to be skipped.\nWith some more help from the villagers we find the trek path back to Khandas through Ganesh ghat. We take almost an hour to reach the Ganesh Ghat-Shidi Ghat bifurcation. A quick breakfast here and we start off towards Ganesh ghat. We’d heard Ganesh ghat was a pretty simple trek path. It’s just about following the path downhill. Rahul, Ashu and Vaijan more or less keep the pace by leading way ahead. The rest of us follow a bit leisurely. By around 12:00pm we reach Khandas village. The eleven of us hustle in a sever seater Minidor and head to Khasheli village. Another Minidor from here gets us to Karjat station by 2:00pm. The train was at 4:00pm so we did have ample time. A sumptuous lunch followed by a much needed Sugarcane juice and we proceed to the station. The tickets that Rahul had booked were on WL so we had to book tickets afresh.\nAnup, Parin, Prashant, Sourabh, Rahul, Trupti, Ashu and I decide to leave for Pune by a Passenger train at 03:30pm instead of waiting for the express at 4:00pm. We get seats but still hurl over to the upper birth, spread the sleeping mats there and sort of settle down totally. The 2.5 hr journey back to Pune is spent playing funny yet interesting games. As I head back home at 06:00pm, it finally sinks in me that Bhimashankar is finally struck in my to-do trek list.\nDetails:\n**Team :**11\nRoute: Swargate -\u0026gt;Khopoli -\u0026gt;Karjat Phata -\u0026gt;Karjat -\u0026gt;Khasheli -\u0026gt;Khandas | ShivajiNagar -\u0026gt;Karjat -\u0026gt;Khasheli -\u0026gt;Khandas\nDistance: Karjat -\u0026gt;Khasheli : ~30kms | Khasheli -\u0026gt;Khandas: ~13kms\nAltitude: ~3650ft. above MSL.\nEndurance: High | Difficulty : Ganesh ghat -\u0026gt; Medium ; Shidi Ghat -\u0026gt; High\nTime : Uphill: 4.5hrs.

Keep walking straight till you reach a small culvert just ahead of a T Junction. The Right path leads you to Ganesh Ghat and the left leads you to Shidi Ghat For Shidi Ghat, Take a left and walk a bit ahead till you find a small Kirana shop. Not very far away take a right and walk ahead. You should be spotting two wells on your left. Walk along the path. Within twenty minutes if you do not spot a small stream / Cascade it\u0026rsquo;s time to think twice before proceeding. For Ganesh ghat take a right and follow the path. Pretty straight forward path up wards. Probability of getting lost for a sane soul is pretty bleak :-) . Once you reach the Bhimashankar peak, to reach the village take a left and move a bit ahead till you find a Pond to your right. The village/ Temple is a straight path from here. Bombay point should be lying to your left as you walk towards the temple. Watch out for signboards en-route. One wild suggestion if you get lost - Take the path to the left. It worked more or less in our case :-) Expenses: Rs 250\nStay: Bhimashankar temple / adjacent stadium. Lodging available\nDuration: Preferable opt for an Overnight stay.\nBest time to visit: Monsoon!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/09/01/the-bhimashankar-trek/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eApproximately 2000 feet above MSL as you cling to your dear life with those nimble fingers, along the crevices of a rock overlooking a deep valley; All you get to sense is the rush of blood across your veins up to your brains!

This is a travel tale of 30 wise morons from various places in India, on a mission to accomplish the R-H trek in three days as India rose to it\u0026rsquo;s 61st year of independence on August 15th. That said, you may want to refer to this link for more info and details.

Get the rules right and tread the path with someone who\u0026rsquo;s been there ample number of times!\nThe Planning:\nSometime during the month of July, one fateful day; Gourav drops a mail to Abhijeet and Suma on a long weekend trip to Pune for a trek. The plan then involved Kalsubai-Ratangad-Katrabai pass-Harishchandragad for a three day stint starting August 15th. With some cross checking and information from reliable sources, the plan is rejected, condensed, reworked and finally tuned. Two weeks before the dead line the plan is sort of base-lined. A team of 10 from Hyd, 12 from Pune and 35+ from B\u0026rsquo;lore were to touch base Pune on the early hours of August 15th. A series of conf. calls and mails throng the network in preparation for the I-day trek. Abhijeet monitors the status remotely from Kolkota. Nominations, food and travel arrangements are almost frozen.\nOn August 12th comes the bomb shell - Incessant rains strike Pune, Dams are full to the brim and a set of places are evacuated. Forecast for the weekend was remotely positive. Nishant gets updates from Nikhil and co. that doing R-H would be a bit dicey. Considering the situation, the B\u0026rsquo;lore team takes a call and all first time trekkers are given a NO-GO signal. The team is now brought down to 10 from B\u0026rsquo;lore, 8 from Hyd and 9 from Pune. All of us were to complete Ratangad - Katrabai pass- Harischandragad. The initial option of dropping out after Ratangad is obviated. So one mini bus and Travera is cancelled. At the last moment Nitin, Manzuma, Bhabhani and Balaji pitch in.\nThe final plan was that a set of seven people - Nishant, Nikhil, Kunal, Ashutosh, Suhas, Nitin and Bhabani would leave for Ratanwadi village by 6:00am and pilot the remaining team. Abhijeet and I would pick the Hyd and B\u0026rsquo;lore folks in a mini bus and move down to Ratanwadi.\nAug 15th:\nShekar wakes me up asking me for directions to Visapur. Giving him the directions I look at the watch. Damn! It was already 05:15am and I\u0026rsquo;d asked the Travera driver to be at Aundh by 05:30 am. I quickly contact him and wake him up from his slumber. By 06:00 am he hits for base and we go about the city picking up Ashu, Bhabhani, Nitin , Nishant, Nikhil and Kunal. The vehicle finally leaves for Ratanwadi at around 07:00am. I head back home and prepare a sumptuous breakfast for myself. A few more calls and I head to pick up the Theplas and chocolates that I\u0026rsquo;d ordered two days back. At 08:45am Gourav calls me informing that the Hyd team would be reaching Pune at about 10:00am. B\u0026rsquo;lore folks would be reaching at 10:35 am by the Lokmanya tilak express. To be on the safer side I google a bit on the place and important village names. At about 10:00am, Sami and I leave for the station with the mini bus. Siva joins us at the station as we wait for B\u0026rsquo;lore folks to arrive. A few minutes later the team arrives and as we hurl the Backpacks and other trekking gear onto the vehicle, Donald, Balaji, Sridar and a couple of other folks head to the station master to get the return ticket modified. For some reason this takes a while and we head for Breman circle at about 11:45am. Hyd folks meanwhile freshen up at my house and head for Breman Circle with Suhas. Abhijeet who\u0026rsquo;s been waiting for a while, gets into the bus at Shivajinagar. We finally leave the city outskirts by around 01:00pm.\nThe driver for some reason just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t cross 60kmph even on the Highway and we happen to reach Sangamner pretty late at about 05:00pm. All through the travel Abhijeet and I try contacting the pilot team to get status of the roads and weather there. As we have a late lunch finally we\u0026rsquo;re able to get the call across and Nishant hints that one of the roads to Bandhardara was blocked due to a landslide and by the time we reach, we may not be able to get a ferry across too. All that we had left was a longer route to traverse through and that would mean adding a couple of hours to the schedule. With no other option in hand we proceed towards Bandhardara through Akole and Rajur across the dam. The travel to the destination goes about with a weird mixture of anxiousness and enthrallment. We have a tough time rationing the Theplas. We were under the assumption that food would be available at the base villages but since we\u0026rsquo;d screwed the whole schedule totally, We had no other option but to stock them for further use. Bad news peps in soon with Nishant calling us and informing that climb uphill to Ratangad should be avoided as far as possible! We finally decide to split into two groups. Balaji, Manzuma, Sami and Pandey were to trek upto Ratangad and then get back to Pune on Saturday while the rest of the team would meet the Pilot team at the R-H bifurcation and proceed via Katrabai pass to Harischandragad.\nAt Rajur, we\u0026rsquo;re advised not to go further beyond Samrad colony as the dense fog and rain would make visibility close to zero. A bit of tinkering here and there in the dense fog and we hit Samrad colony finally. It\u0026rsquo;s close to 11:00pm. Hunger just adds up to the long travel strain that the B\u0026rsquo;lore and Hyd folks have had and all that anyone around there was thinking of was to hit the floor as soon as possible. Kedar and Sridhar distribute the Sleeping bags and mats and in a few moments everyone dozes.\nAug 16th:\nMorning at about 4:30 am, we\u0026rsquo;re woken up and by 06:00am we head towards Ratanwadi. Abhijeet and I scout for a route, find the wrong one and lead the bus there. Fortunately a villager redirects us to the right path and from there on we manage to reach the Ratanwadi village. We pay a brief visit to the temple and about 07:45am leave for the R-H Bifurcation with two villagers as we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to lose any more time. At about 09:00am we reach the bifurcation. The pilot team too happens to reach at almost the same time. We have a quick introduction and from then on decide to walk as soon as possible to reach Kumshet village. After a series of getting lost in the foliage , despite having a guide we manage to reach Katrabai pass at about 11:30am. All that drives us ahead is the assumption that we\u0026rsquo;d find food in the base village. The road never seems to end and it takes a while before we reach the village. The moment we reach Kumshet all eye\u0026rsquo;s scout for a fireplace and a vessel above it. Ah! Surprises never come when you need them. The villagers inform us that had we been there a bit earlier they could have arranged something. Cooking now for 30 of us was simply out of question. Nikhil then informs we may be able to find something to eat at Pachnai village. But for that we\u0026rsquo;ll have to leave as early as possible as a river was to be crossed. From hearsay we get to know that the river was in spate and crossing it would be very risky and difficult. Theplas had to be kept as the last option and we move ahead after gobbling a set of munchies. Had blessings been tangible, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;d be suffocating to death from people showering them on me for having made such wonderful arrangements for food.\nEveryone is literally pissed off and we finally take a call. Not one of us walks slowly till we reach Pachnai village. Gourav, Animesh and Kedar brief people and we move on with high spirits. Food at times can be such a motivating factor! More so, if you\u0026rsquo;ve had literally nothing for the past two days! About fifteen minutes of pure hiking and thankfully we get to see a river flowing about 300 feet below us at the end of the plateau. It\u0026rsquo;s a breath taking sight from here and we\u0026rsquo;re literally hooked to this place for about five minutes. \u0026lsquo;Something\u0026rsquo; again reminds us of our destination and we head down through the hillock and reach the base.\nLearn the Fisherman\u0026rsquo;s knot :-) !\nAs we near the point where the river is to be crossed we really get to see and feel the real currents. From the 300ft hillock, what looked like a silent stream was indeed a river in full spate. Nishant tries wading through to test and see if the stream was traversable. The rock climbing rope that the B\u0026rsquo;lore team got all the way from B\u0026rsquo;lore finally comes to use here. Nitin and Abhijeet wade through the currents to the other side of the stream and tether it to a bark of a tree. While Nikhil and a couple of other folks tag it to a stout tree at this end. One by one each of us cross the stream with the rope\u0026rsquo;s support and reach over to the other side. You need to have a look at the snaps and videos to really admire the team work that happened across there! Nitin was really helpful in doling out his scout expertise there but I guess the fisherman\u0026rsquo;s knot was the best part of it all :-) ! As we cross the stream and walk a bit ahead, we get to see a village not far across. Moments before we fall under the impression that this could be Pachnai, we\u0026rsquo;re told by a few villagers that we crossed the stream unnecessarily and we had to head to another place instead of this. From here starts the way back across the stream but from a different point where the current was not that powerful. A couple of villagers help us cross the stream and get to the other side. Once on the land, we had to walk a few more yards ahead and cross another easily traversable stream and finally we hit land for good. I wonder what we would have done had we not carried the ropes along with us!\nTrust your instincts.\nThe stream crossing sort of re-vitalizes us and we move ahead towards Pachnai. Walk, Walk and Walk was the sole mantra! Two hours and still no sight of any village. Every turn round the corner we hope in vain to spot a villager, but then Murphy always wins! At around 7:00pm, the gap between the team widens and people slowly start giving up. To avoid blackout\u0026rsquo;s we finally remove the penultimate reserve of Theplas and chocolates. About twenty minutes is spent flat in the middle of the road. Siva had brought some sweet bun and mixture. We\u0026rsquo;re least bothered of anything, as we rest in eternal glory chomping on the little food that we had in our hands. Having regained a bit of energy the ten of us walk along the path. Rains are something that we now start detesting! Dusk looms and we get our torches outside. Not one of us is really sure if we\u0026rsquo;re moving on the right path. All that we knew was that we had to keep moving on and on till wherever the road leads. At a certain point the road bifurcates into two. Tired of taking decisions we follow our instinct and take the road to the left. Finally after about thirty minutes of walk we come across a tarred road. A bit of relief thumps in our veins. The tarred road for sure meant we were heading to a village - How far was an issue, but then we at least had a goal now!\nSomeone\u0026rsquo;s found us!\nAs the quest for human beings continues, somewhere far ahead we hear a double whistle hoot. Boy, Oh! Boy. We\u0026rsquo;re overwhelmed. I instantly pull out the whistle from the sling and respond the call. We run a bit ahead and make sure the call is from one of our folks by the adventura whistle code. A bit ahead as we turn round the corner we see headlamps flickering. We\u0026rsquo;ve finally found the team! In a few moments we have Nikhil and Donald running in our direction. They guide us along a bit ahead and inform us that they\u0026rsquo;ve found the Pachnai Village. Food arrangements have been made and everyone in the team is safe! We\u0026rsquo;re sure had Donald and Nikhil not traced back the route to find us we\u0026rsquo;d stopped right at the spot where the tarred road was submerged by a small stream in spate. We finally make it to the village in about fifteen minutes guided by a villager. These villagers rock!\nThe expressions on the faces of everyone, as we huddle in the cow-shed warming up in front of the Kerosene lamps is something that I\u0026rsquo;d never forget! As the Besan dal and rice go down the our throats, a burning sensation grips the flow. Getting to eat proper food after about two days of hiking,wandering and losing the way is heavenly pleasure. Every little step becomes painful and all that anyone was looking forward to was to hit the floor. Nikhil and Nishant help in sorting out the temple floor for everyone to sleep.In moments we\u0026rsquo;re equivalent to dead logs!\nAug 17th:\nAt about 7:00am after a hot cup of milkless tea, Nikhil, Nishant, Kunal and Nitin decide to move ahead to Harishchandragad. The Hyd team had to reach Pune by 4:00pm and not many from the B\u0026rsquo;lore team were ready to walk another mile. The final action plan was to reach Pune ASAP! We had to contact the drivers of the Mini bus and the travera as they\u0026rsquo;d not yet reached Pachnai village as asked to. As there\u0026rsquo;s no network coverage in the village, Our host at the village volunteers to take us to a place about 3kms from here where we could get coverage. Once we reach this spot and dial the numbers, we\u0026rsquo;re in for more surprises! The drivers are not reachable. With no option left, we decide to walk another 4kms and reach lavaii village from where we could PROBABLY find a means of transport to Khireshwar and then to Pune. Abhijeet and I have literally no idea how we\u0026rsquo;re about to spell this out to the B\u0026rsquo;lore and Hyd team. As we almost come to a conclusion that the Hyd team would have to miss their train, round the corner the Pink Satava mini bus followed by the Travera winds up the road. Phew, We\u0026rsquo;re more than exhilarated!\nThe Hyd team leaves in the travera and later we get to know they\u0026rsquo;d reached right on time. The remaining twelve of us head for Rajur hoping to get news from the other four who\u0026rsquo;d started their climb up Harischandragad. All attempts to contact them turns futile as none of them are reachable Finally at about 02:00pm we get a call from Nishant from a village booth giving us their location. At about 05:30pm we reach NarayanGaon and stop there for tea. As we have a befitting snack, Nishant calls us and lets us know that they were somewhere close to Junner and would be able to make it to NarayanGaon in probably another thirty minutes. At about 07:00pm the group of four finally make it to the place where we were waiting and we head towards Pune. At 11:30 pm as I make the final payment for the vehicles at Aundh and head back home and recall the eventful past three days, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the first mail that Gourav had dropped :-) .\nMost of us haven\u0026rsquo;t covered Ratangad and Harischandragad as planned. But I guess, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of learning and enriching experiences that we\u0026rsquo;d take back home from the villages that we\u0026rsquo;ve hit.\nI wish I could capture the moment when people got to see real food on the second night at the Cow-Shed! That would have been the Kodak moment of the trip. As Abhijeet once put it, Trekking is not all about reaching the peak, It\u0026rsquo;s the expressions that you get to see on the faces of people at times that makes the trip all the more enriching. Miles to go before you Sleep !\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/08/19/the-katrabai-pass-trek/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;ve hit this page looking for directions on the Ratangad - Harishchandragad trek; I\u0026rsquo;m afraid, the bots have routed you to the wrong page.

It\u0026rsquo;s been close to a year that I\u0026rsquo;ve had dinner with any of my Engg. mates. This time during dinner, there are no tickets to ponder on, no actions items to be worked upon, no resolutions to be done; Just plain simple talk pulling each others legs! This would probably be etched as one of those few dinner\u0026rsquo;s I\u0026rsquo;d remember for quite sometime. We reach home at about 11:30pm. I hit the ground with an aching knee reminding me of today morning\u0026rsquo;s incident while rappelling. At times, pain is pleasure!\n10th Aug\nMy alarm hoots at 04:45 am. While Chandru gets ready in a jiffy, I literally kick sriram and get him on his toes. Sunil had come down to my place yesterday night. Hitanshu\u0026rsquo;s almost done with his morning breakfast. Suhas finally makes it to Aundh at about 05:40am. Suhas, Sriram and I hire a rick to ShivajiNagar bus stand. Half way through, I get a call from Akhilesh telling me the Bus to Bhor was to be boarded at Swargate and not at ShivajiNagar as I had mentioned in the final coordination mail yesterday. Damn! This is when it looms over me that what he said made real perfect sense. For the Rohida trek too we\u0026rsquo;d boarded the bus to Bhor at Swargate and not at Shivaji Nagar. I\u0026rsquo;d asked everyone to reach Shivajinagar by 6:00am and here I was to ask them to come over to Swargate again. As I call people and inform them of the change, I literally hear them swearing on me for my timely notice :-) .\nThe bus to Bhor was at about 06:45 am. Twelve of us - Akhilesh, Ashish, Arjun,Suhas, Swati, Hitanshu, Sourabh,Sriram, Shekar, Sunil, Rohit and I board the bus while Soujanya narrowly misses it. We decide to proceed and wait at Bhor. At about 08:15 am we reach Bhor. We had to reach Korla village which is about 20kms from here, to start the trek to Raireshwar. The next bus to Korla was at about 09:00am. Suhas and I decide to talk to the local guys there and arrange for a Jeep. After some deliberations we hit on a guy who accepts to drop us and pick us from the base village for 550Rs flat. We\u0026rsquo;re more than happy and strike the deal. It would take at least another half an hour for Soujanya to reach Bhor, So we decide to have breakfast at Bhor itself. At around 09:00am Soujanya finally makes it to Bhor and at 09:15am we depart for Korla. The thirteen of us hunch into a Jeep. Ashish, Shekar, Sriram sit on the front troubling the driver right from the start while Hitanshu, Akhilesh and I hang out from the rear of the Jeep enjoying the drizzle as the vehicle speeds up the road to Korla. About five kms ahead of the Korla village we come across a thumping river crook. The sheer force with which water was making it\u0026rsquo;s way out of the canal was simply exhilrating. A few minutes here and we move ahead to the village. At about 10:00am we reach the base village and start the trek.\nFrom the Korla village a diversion to the left takes you to Kenjalgad fort while the one to the right takes you to the famous Raireshwar temple and village. As we start walking up through the clearly paved road up to the village, we have an uninvited guest who further happens to be the 14th member in the team. Dogs are known to be pretty faithful beings and they follow you everywhere you go. But I guess it\u0026rsquo;s the other way round when it comes to hills. You\u0026rsquo;re compelled to follow them :-) !\nThe path up to Raireshwar for the most part of it is already clear cut. But what\u0026rsquo;s really spectacular about this place is that, unlike any other fort/ hill village; once you start from the base and walk a few yards ahead, You\u0026rsquo;d be walking literally through paths surrounded by high rise hills everwhere around you and it all looks so spaced out that you\u0026rsquo;re really showered down by the magnanimity of Nature. The incessant drizzle at a distance makes you feel as if Nature\u0026rsquo;s trying to unveil it\u0026rsquo;s creation slowly through a striated screen. It looks so damn beautiful that you\u0026rsquo;re literally left spell bound. The innumerable falls that rise out of nowhere keep you on your nimble feet and every turn round the hill only gives way to more picturesque landscapes!\nHalf way up the hill, we come across a person by name Gopal who says he could arrange food for us up there in the village. He then suggests he\u0026rsquo;d get there to the village and prepare food by the time we reach there. What he said made perfect sense so we agree. A waterfall on the way keeps us busy for a while and even before we realise we\u0026rsquo;ve almost spent close to half an hour there. Finally we decide to move further and cover quite some distance. At one point we come across a diversion and decide to take the one that went upwards. A \u0026lsquo;No Overtaking\u0026rsquo; board round the corner indicated that this road was slowly being developed to help ply regular vehicles up the fort. We follow the path mindlessly only to realise a while later that we\u0026rsquo;re on the wrong path.. A frail old village woman finally guides us in the right direction and we tread forward. From here on, the further we go, the better it gets! There\u0026rsquo;s this particular spot wherein you climb up a small hillock and the moment you reach this spot and look ahead you get to see a massive rock ahead of you and a series of cascades to either side of it. A splendid combination of Beauty and Magnanimity, I would say!\nFrom this spot, to reach the Raireshwar village you need to climb a series of about 3oo steps. At the end of the climb a metal staircase has been built to facilitate easy climb for the regular villagers. But for this, the climb up would have been really difficult. Once we reach the top of the hillock and walk a few yards ahead, we get to meet a person whom Gopal had sent in search of us. This guy leads us to the village temple which is believed to be the spot where Sivaji took his oath to Swaraj. Based on the land they own each villager is given authority to maintain the temple. A small but extremely well maintained one! We then move over to Gopal\u0026rsquo;s house for a sumptuous lunch. None of us realised how cold it was up there until we sat still in the house for sometime. The moment we enter his house and settle down, cold fumes come out of our body! Sriram literally sits beside the stove to keep himselves warm. At about 3:00pm we leave from Gopal\u0026rsquo;s place and start out trek down. The way downhill is done with in about an hour and a half. The Jeep driver is a bit cross with us for having turned up almost an hour late, but a few minutes with the Bombayz is all it takes to get him back to form. The next bus to Pune was right in the Bhor Bus stand. The Bombayz too are compelled to get back to Pune and from then on move over to Mumbai as they\u0026rsquo;re left with no other option.\nOn a personal front, I\u0026rsquo;d rate Raireshwar to be my second best trek. Most of the credit goes not to the endurance or difficulty but to bounty that Nature\u0026rsquo;s got in store for you here!\nDetails:\n**Team :**13\nRoute: Swargate -\u0026gt; Bhor -\u0026gt; Korla village -\u0026gt; Raireshwar/ Kinjelgad\nDistance: Bhor -\u0026gt; Korla village [ 20kms ] Korla -\u0026gt; Raireshwar [~8kms]\nAltitude: ~4250ft. above MSL.\nEndurance: Low | Difficulty : Low/Medium [ At the fag end ]\nTime : Uphill: 3hrs.

It\u0026rsquo;s been close to a year that I\u0026rsquo;ve had dinner with any of my Engg. mates. This time during dinner, there are no tickets to ponder on, no actions items to be worked upon, no resolutions to be done; Just plain simple talk pulling each others legs! This would probably be etched as one of those few dinner\u0026rsquo;s I\u0026rsquo;d remember for quite sometime. We reach home at about 11:30pm. I hit the ground with an aching knee reminding me of today morning\u0026rsquo;s incident while rappelling. At times, pain is pleasure!\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Raireshwar trek"},{"content":"The blue tarpaulin sheet suddenly gives way and my feet impulsively tries to gain hold on the rocks. I lose grip and one of my slippers hits the rocks about hundred and fifty feet below. Even before I have time to think on what\u0026rsquo;s apparently gone wrong I foolishly tag the rope in my left hand instead of the right. And just one thought zips in my mind.. Damn! I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have volunteered to be the first one to rappel down!\nAug 8th:\nI pick the 4:00pm service back to Aundh and reach home at about 4:45pm only to learn that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the room keys with me. A brief sprint towards Breman Circle and I manage to hitch a ride to Pune station. As Bhavana and Nikunj make their way from Kothrud , I purchase onward tickets to Karjat for the 6:30pm Indrayini express. At about 8:15pm the train hoots into Karjat. Amps travelling from Mumbai was to be at Karjat at around the same time. In about ten minutes she joins us. The plan was to camp at Kondu\u0026rsquo;s place at Kondividi that night. Folks from the Dhumketu trekkers group were to reach Kondividi early the next morning.\nAt about 09:00pm we get some light dinner packed for the night. Means of commutation to the Kondividi village is pretty scarce. Thankfully, for 250 bucks a rick. driver agrees to take us there. The 20kms of travel on the kutcha road devoid of any lighting with rain pouring all way through made for an indeed interesting start! To add thrill to the already distraughted travel , the rick\u0026rsquo;s headlight kept blowing off every time the rick bumped on the pothole ridden road. At about 09:40pm we reach Kondu\u0026rsquo;s place. As I learn later, Kondu\u0026rsquo;s place has been a vital pit stop for Dhumketu trekkers for quite some time now. We\u0026rsquo;re provided a warm welcome and a lady sets up the courtyard of their house for us to sleep. After a quick dinner we hit the floor. Sleeping in an open courtyard of an old village house with rain splashing on the extended roof of the house is not something that you get to experience nowadays! Besides company of a smelling dog all night long is also something that you never get to experience ;-) .\nAug 9th:\nAt about 02:30 am the Dhumketu trekkers core team arrives from Mumbai. The dog\u0026rsquo;s given me company long enough to keep my nose and eyes shut. At about 06:30 am we\u0026rsquo;re woken up from our slumber by Sanjay. In five minutes we\u0026rsquo;re up and start walking towards the Kondividi caves. The hike up till there reminds me of the Rajmachi trek. Kondividi caves is at the base point of the Rajmachi trek at the Karjat side.\nBy the time we reach the caves, the DT team had almost completed setting up the ropes for the rappelling. A blue tarpaulin sheet was being setup from the 150 odd feet rock to avoid bruises while rappelling down. A quick cleaning up of the caves and we\u0026rsquo;re set to have a great time. The Pune team was yet to reach so Nikunj and I hit to the waterfalls, while Bhavna and Amps pick a conversation with Sanjay and team. At about 10:30 am we decide to start rappelling. A quick climb up the hillock through the left side and we reach the top. Just another small yet powerful waterfall grabs our attention. A few minutes under the frothing waters and we\u0026rsquo;re asked to get back and adorn the rappelling gear.\nBhavna and I volunteer to be the scapegoats. This was my second attempt on Rappelling. The first was during the Skandagiri trek at Bangalore almost a year back. As I straddle the rope against my body, position my feet and let my body loose giving full control to the rope and the descender; a chill passes down my spine for no apparent reason. I get the go command and slowly start descending the cliff. The first few steps backwards and I already start faltering shamelessly by bending my knees and not giving appropriate distance to the feet. A stern look from the person above gets me back to my senses and I slowly gain control.\nRappelling at Kolar caves was on a low height, dry and flat surface all the way to the bottom. There you could get support from the vertical side too. But here after a few feet from the top, the cliff caves in and you have nothing to get grip on. The blue tarpaulin sheet in a way was misguiding and even before i knew the cliff was caving in, my left foot prods through the tarpaulin, trying in vain to get hold of something. One look down and I see one of my slippers hitting the rocks below. The rope suddenly swivels and I literally hang in thin air almost 100 ft above the ground - all at the mercy of the person controlling my speed of descent. In anxiety I let loose more rope from my left hand instead of holding it close to my body . Down I go faster than gauged. Fortunately, I soon gain control and stabilize myself. From then on the descent down goes pretty subtly and in about thirty seconds I touch ground! Bhavna follows suit in a few minutes. And it\u0026rsquo;s all done!\nNikunj and Amps warn me twice before I rappell down to click shots of them rappelling once I reach the base. I pick the cam from the bag and move over to a suitable place to get the snaps. In about another ten minutes they\u0026rsquo;re done with the rappelling too. It\u0026rsquo;s close to 11:00am and the team from Pune hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet turned up. Nikunj , Amps and I get back to the falls and spend almost an hour or so in the freezing waters. The pressure in the falls has tremendously increased. I finally manage to find my lost slipper amidst the rocks . At about 11:30am the Pune team finally arrives. DT folks give them a general precautionary briefing and starts the rappelling activity for them pretty soon. As we get out of the falls Bhavna asks Nikunj for a pic. This is when we realise someone\u0026rsquo;s stolen the cam from the bag. All cellphones, wallets and cards seem to be intact.There seems to be no leads as to when and how someone could have flicked it off!\nFinally we decide to leave Kondivide by around 2:15pm. Amps was to get back to Mumbai and Bhavna had booked return tickets for three of us by the Deccan Express at 6:00pm from Karjat. So we had to rush! Bhavna\u0026rsquo;s throat gives in for no reason and she barely manages to speak a few syllables. We\u0026rsquo;re literally left penniless and hunger seems to be growing by the minute. Finally, At about 08:00pm we reach Pune station.\nOn another dimention, the Bombayz had already reached my home at Aundh. Nikunj drops me at my place at about 09:00pm. Pranesh and Tiwari join us for a sumptuous dinner at Rasoi Ghar and we head back home at about 10:30pm. As just another exciting day comes to an end, and as I hit the bed, I set the alarm to 04:45 am. The Raireshwar trek was planned for Sunday ;-) .\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/08/12/waterfall-rappelling-at-kondividi/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe blue tarpaulin sheet suddenly gives way and my feet impulsively tries to gain hold on the rocks.

The first being, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the youngest member in the team; the second being we had a 10 year senior,quite oblivious to us, sitting silently listening to all the *facts* about organisations and policies that we were putting forward; the third would get pretty evident as the print runs through till the end of this post!\n01st August:\nI manage to fling the much awaited Sev2 resolution off the DS3 connection and zip across the eggs to board the 9:15 service back home. Thankfully , there\u0026rsquo;s a seat left just beside Walia in the Medipoint bus. Even before I get to settle down, my cell beeps with an unknown caller at the other end. Chetan, I re-collect had not responded to the mail that I\u0026rsquo;d fired sometime earlier in the day. He\u0026rsquo;d called just to enquire if he could still make it for tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s trek. Some cross checking and linking and we\u0026rsquo;re all set for co-ordinating tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s trek. Walia bangs his head to the seat in front of him. Damn! You never change . He\u0026rsquo;s got no questions to ask on my plans for the weekend!\n02nd August:\nA couple of wake up calls gets me back to real senses and at about 5:30am I rush towards Aundh Junction where Prayank and Vishal were to pitch in. Hitanshu soon joins in a few minutes and we manage to reach Shivaji nagar station by 6:05am. Rahul, Vishal and co have been waiting there right from 5:30 am ! Soon people pitch in and by around 06:15 the final count swells to 26. Lohagad-Visapur spells out to be a sequel to the Koraigad trek. The 6:30 local to Lonavala pulls into the station right on time. Rahul,Trupti,Abhijeet, Chetan and I hurl ourselves into a coupe and soon in minutes everyone gets into form. From nowhere a heated up discussion starts about job roles, company issues, policies, coding goofs and what not. Amidst all this Hitanshu just confirms with others if none of us were Job band D or above. Wonder why the ball was never thrown to Chetan. This chap remains silent all through the discussion and just keeps smiling now and then. Later we get to know the reason for that wierd behaviour of his. 10 years of Experience does take it\u0026rsquo;s toll. NOM :-) !\nWe reach Malavli station at about 8:00am. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to reach Bhaje village which is about 2kms from here by walk and from there on start towards Visapur/Lohagad. Dhok who\u0026rsquo;d been here before leads us through the follow-up over-bridge above the Express highway to Bhaje village.As our order of VadaPav and Chai gets processed, probably for the first time ever in DH\u0026rsquo;s trek history we have a formal introductory sesssion :-) . This big a size definitely called for a formal introduction! As people go about introducing themselves to the group, we get to know there\u0026rsquo;re about seven folks less experienced than me in Infy. I\u0026rsquo;m on cloud nine! Nothing really spectacular about it. But I guess small things do make a difference :-) .\nAt about 9:30am we start moving towards Visapur-Lohagad. Just a few yards away from Bhaje village, you get to come across a beautiful waterfall. Though a couple of us decided to cover this in the latter half of the journey, not many of us could control our anxiety to get under the chilling falls. Dhok and Swati are blessed with minor bruises. Probably, you could call it a sacrifice that they\u0026rsquo;d pledged to nature! About half an hour here sets the right spirits and we sprint over to the main path and get back on track. The road from here is pretty much well laid out and is motorable to a certain extent. In about an hour or so we happen to reach the Visapur-Lohagad diversion. Lohagad stands to your right and Visapur to your left. A small confusion pops in as to which is the right place but soon it all precipitates down and we decide to finish Lohagad first.\nGiving consistent company to the monkeys, We hit Lohagad peak in about another hour or so and while away quite some time on the fort. One particular spot ( Burj) gives you a spectacular view of the valley below. The gusty chilly wind and the mist make it all the more beautiful. At the other end of the fort , there\u0026rsquo;s one another spot wherein the thumping force of the winds on the bulwarks, literally raises water from the down flowing cascades and spews it across all over causing an illusion of rainfall happening in the reverse direction.I\u0026rsquo;ve never experienced this powerful and scenic a phenomena as this till date.We loose track of time and even before we realise it\u0026rsquo;s already 3:00pm. In twenty minutes flat we hit the base and have a quick lunch. By four we reach the Visapur - Lohagad diversion. To have consensus and re-confirm if everyone was fine with doing Visapur a poll is done. Not surprisingly, everyone\u0026rsquo;s game for it.\nPatience pays when Reasoning doesn\u0026rsquo;t!\nThe Visapur trek starts at about 4:30pm. Rahul, Trupti, Dhok, Prayank and I happen to walk a bit ahead of the group and even before we realise, we make our first mistake - Loose track of the actual place where a diversion is to be taken to climb up the fort. Fortunately, we get to meet two people who\u0026rsquo;d already lost track before us and were on their way back looking for the actual path. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to take a left a few minutes after you take a left at the L-V diversion . The path from here to the fort up there is an awesome piece of the whole cake! Indeed thrilling to climb up the small rocks amidst water flowing through the whole path. As none of us were sure of the path up the fort, a few of us had to stay put in between while Dhok, Prayank, Parin, Rahul explored further. Abhijeet and I try in vain in exploring for a simpler route. Finally at about 5:15pm, having got not much of a positive response from the folks who\u0026rsquo;d gone a bit ahead to check for the path, Abhijeet gives the NO-GO signal and part of the team heads back to the base diversion point. I was sent to get back Dhok and a couple of others; but it so happened that I ended up reaching almost three forth of the climb so didn\u0026rsquo;t mind getting to the top altogether :-) . At about 6:00pm Dhok, Parin, Akhilesh, Prayank and I head back downwards through the cascades to the base and meet up with the rest of the team who\u0026rsquo;d been waiting there. The moment I arrive, Abhijeet pulls me out and takes me away from the group. I was almost sure he\u0026rsquo;s going to give me a sound bashing for not having followed his advise and got back the people who\u0026rsquo;d ventured before me. Surprisingly he takes me to a small diversion just before the path we\u0026rsquo;d taken and shows me the path. One pointing made everything crystal clear - We could have taken the whole team up there and avoided the cascade climb :-) . But damage was long done!\nThe sprint back to the base:\nVisapur was indeed the apple pie of the Visapur-Lohagad trek. Probably this weekend trek wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been as interesting as it was had we not covered Visapur. Vishal and I sprint all the way from the diversion to the base village Bhaje in about 15 minutes. We come across another waterfall that we had not stopped during our climb up and decide to jump in with no second thoughts. This waterfall was far more powerful than the first one and indeed pretty much comforting after the sprint. It starts raining heavily and only then do i realise that I\u0026rsquo;d left my Cell without much protection in my bag. Ah! There it goes\u0026hellip;Plop - Contact service.\nA quick bout of vada-pav\u0026rsquo;s and we board the 7:30pm local back to Pune. To be frank, neither of these two forts can be counted in as treks. I would put them in the Hiking bucket instead. But I guess it\u0026rsquo;s the smile that you get to see on people\u0026rsquo;s faces when they hit the peak after a tiresome climb up the hill that really brings in the vibes!\n[/fruitful_tab]\n[fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Hike Details\u0026rdquo;]\n**Team Count :**26\nRoute: Shivaji Nagar \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Malavli ( One stop before lonavala) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Bhaje village \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Visapur-Lohagad diversion \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;(Right at diversion)Lohagad climb \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Lohagad Descent\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Back to Diversion \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;(Left) Visapur climb\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Waterfall/ Cascade climb uphill\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Visapur Descent ( same route ) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;Back to Diversion\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Bhaje village \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Bhaje caves \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Malavli station \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Shivaji Nagar (Pune)\nDistance: Malavli \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Bhaje village (2.5kms).

That`s because great service is a choice.\nYears ago, Harvey Mackay, (Business Motivational Speaker \u0026amp; Inspirational Quotes - Harvey Mackay) told a wonderful story about a cab driver that proved this point. He was waiting in line for a ride at the airport. When a cab pulled up, the first thing Harvey noticed was that the taxi was polished to a bright shine. Smartly dressed in a white shirt, black tie, and freshly pressed black slacks, the cab driver jumped out and rounded the car to open the back passenger door for Harvey. He handed him a laminated card and said:\n`I`m Wally, your driver. While I`m loading your bags in the trunk I`d like you to read my mission statement.` Taken aback, Harvey read the card. It said:\nWally`s Mission Statement:\nTo get my customers to their destination in the quickest, safest and cheapest way possible in a friendly environment.This blew Harvey away. Especially when he noticed that the inside of the cab matched the outside. Spotlessly clean! As he slid behind the wheel, Wally said, `Would you like a cup of coffee? I have a thermos of regular and one of decaf.`Harvey said jokingly, `No, I`d prefer a soft drink.`Wally smiled and said, `No problem. I have a cooler up front with regular and Diet Coke, water and orange juice.`Almost stuttering, Harvey said, `I`ll take a Diet Coke.`Handing him his drink, Wally said, `If you`d like something to read, I have The Wall Street Journal, Time, Sports Illustrated and USA Today.`As they were pulling away, Wally handed him another laminated card. `These are the stations I get and the music they play, if you`d like to listen to the radio.`And as if that weren`t enough, Wally told Harvey that he had the air conditioning on and asked if the temperature was comfortable for him. Then he advised Harvey of the best route to his destination for that time of day. He also let him know that he`d be happy to chat and tell him about some of the sights or, if Harvey preferred, to leave him with his own thoughts.`Tell me, Wally,` Harvey asked the driver, `have you always served customers like this?` Wally smiled into the rearview mirror. `No, not always. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s only been in the last two years. My first five years driving, I spent most of my time complaining like all the rest of the cabbies do.Then I heard the personal growth guru, Wayne Dyer, on the radio one day. He had just written a book called You`ll See It When You Believe It. Dyer said that if you get up in the morning expecting to have a bad day, you`ll rarely disappoint yourself.He said, `Stop complaining! Differentiate yourself from your competition. Don`t be a duck. Be an eagle. Ducks quack and complain. Eagles soar above the crowd.```That hit me right between the eyes,` said Wally. `Dyer was really talking about me. I was always quacking and complaining, so I decided to change my attitude and become an eagle. I looked around at the other cabs and their drivers. The cabs were dirty, the drivers were unfriendly, and the customers were unhappy. So I decided to make some changes. I put in a few at a time. When my customers responded well, I did more.``I take it that has paid off for you,` Harvey said. `It sure has,` Wally replied. `My first year as an eagle, I doubled my income from the previous year. This year I`ll probably quadruple it. You were lucky to get me today. I don`t sit at cabstands anymore. My customers call me for appointments on my cell phone or leave a message on my answering machine. If I can`t pick them up myself, I get a reliable cabbie friend to do it and I take a piece of the action.`Wally was phenomenal. He was running a limo service out of a Yellow Cab. Harvey probably told that story to more than fifty cab drivers over the years, and only two took the idea and ran with it. Whenever Harvey went to their cities, he would give them a call. The rest of the drivers quacked like ducks and told him all the reasons they couldn`t do any of what he was suggesting.Wally the Cab Driver made a different choice , he decided to stop quacking like ducks and start soaring like eagles. How about you? Apply it in your own businesses and homes and see the change around you.Where Eagles Dare.\nSource: E-mail Forward\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/08/01/the-duck-and-the-eagle/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAn interesting read!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one can make you serve customers well.

It\u0026rsquo;s been an adventure in the real sense! Walking through the dense vegetation with no idea where, when or how we\u0026rsquo;re going to turn up, not even remotely bothered of what could have been happening in the cities out there; losing paths and realising it after you\u0026rsquo;ve covered two or three kms;Tramping the 40+ kms in the splintering rain stopping just for nourishment en-route right from 09:00am all through till 09:00pm; taking respite in those scores of waterfalls rejuvenating our muscles and senses; crossing knee deep torrential streams just to find another just a few kms away; Groping to find directions in the dark.Phew! Indeed been one of THE best treks I\u0026rsquo;ve covered till date during my brief stay here in Pune.\nJuly 25th:\nEven at about, 3:00pm the count for this weekend trip stood at four. Blame us for not planning things ahead. Dhok! Abhijeet and Rahul were pre-occupied with personal work. Just as I\u0026rsquo;m about to drop plans to have a trek this weekend and plan to head for mumbai, Suhas calls and says he\u0026rsquo;s game for the weekend, come what may. In moments we decide to head for Rajmachi and drop a mail to the DH group and the Infy BB. Surprisingly and thankfully we do not have many takers this weekend. Neither of us had been here before and all we had was blogs and posts elsewhere to guide us till the end; so but for Ashutosh we did not consistently prod anyone to join us. Besides, Dhok had mentioned the plan that i\u0026rsquo;d sketched was a bit too far-stretched and we\u0026rsquo;d have to run against time if we had to get back to Pune that very day.\nSuhas calls me sometime at night tells me that the trek route that I\u0026rsquo;d decided upon would be a bit strenuous and we should consider the Lonavala side instead. Bet he\u0026rsquo;s still accusing me for not having payed any heed to his advice :-) .\nJuly 26th:\nPost his night shift, Suhas gives me a call at around 04:30am letting me know that he\u0026rsquo;d be at my house in ten minutes and damn! he\u0026rsquo;s right on time at my doorstep. Gaurav drops a message that he and a friend of his wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be joining us. Vishal, probably deep in slumber, doesn\u0026rsquo;t even pick up my wake up call. The final count ends at five - Akhilesh, Sunil, Suhas, Ashutosh and I.\nWe\u0026rsquo;d to board the 6:12 Sahyadri passenger to Karjat. Akhilesh boards it at Shivaji nagar, while the remaining four of us board at Khadki. I spend the two hour journey deep in sleep while others enjoy the sahayadris at Lonavala. We reach Karjat at 08:15 am, hit on vada pav\u0026rsquo;s for breakfast and head quickly to the Karjat bus depot only to realise that we\u0026rsquo;d just missed the 08:15 service to Khandpe. The next bus was at 09:45am. It didn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense to waste time there so we pick a rick. to a popular place called \u0026lsquo;Bridge\u0026rsquo; and from there move over to the Khandpe village in a Tum-Tum. The driver suggested he would drop us at Kondane but we decide to get down at Kondivane and trek from there.\nThe road less taken huh!\nWe\u0026rsquo;re at Kondivide at about 09:30am - right as planned. The villagers guide us in the right directions; fortunately, we had Suhas who could help us out with Marathi. Nature seemed to hint that we\u0026rsquo;re in for some trouble right at the moment we set our foot at Kondane village. We reach a Y forked road and decide to take the right arm and move ahead. A few more enquiries and we seem to be on the right path. At about 10:00am we manage to reach a place which remotely looked as the base point of the actual trek. It\u0026rsquo;s been raining heavily for the past few hours and there are no signs of it subsiding any time soon. Just to re-confirm we ask a few people if it was reasonable enough to climb to Rajmachi in this climate. They\u0026rsquo;re not really affirmative and suggest taking one of the villagers as a guide. But thanks to our eccentric minds we decide to take the final call and move on without a guide.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re invited to the dense foliage by murky waters. We had to climb uphill, so by logic we decided to follow the downstreams upwards whenever possible just to keep track of our path. This did help us definitely to a large extent and we soon manage to reach a tableland. A villager was selling corn by the side. That just gave us the much needed energy for the path ahead. We\u0026rsquo;re then directed to the right path again and then in a few moments trouble looms in again. We again seemed to be heading to nowhere.\nWho even wants to be at Kuttralam?\nA bit of groping and topographic analysis does help getting us somewhere. Just then the sound of gurgling water happens to surge into our ears and we quickly move in that direction. A small turn to the left and we\u0026rsquo;re stumped by the force with which water was rising from the rocks after having fallen from a height of about fifty feet. With no second thoughts the five of us head to the falls and spend some mighty good time there. It all looked like a conspiracy by nature to rejuvenate us and guide us along the right path! We’d already been lagging behind schedule so with a heavy mind we leave the falls and move ahead. A bit ahead the path seemed to be a bit laid out and we had reason to believe that we were in the right path at least for sometime. It was indeed difficult to cut short our desires to spend time at the innumerable waterfalls en-route. Every turn ahead had a cascade or a fall!\nThe Kondane Caves\nTotally drenched as we move ahead hoping to find the right path, just another fall invites us. But this was totally different! I remember seeing this particular place in a pic. , as a forward sometime back. A powerful but thin sheet of water falling from a towering height of about 100feet and an architectural splendour in the form of huge caves right behind the falls - Looked like we\u0026rsquo;d been transmitted over to some time ages before the existence of mankind! These caves had two floors and were very spacious to accommodate about a fifty people easily. This could probably be a wonderful spot to camp at night. Akhilesh and I fancy making the trek an overnight camp but then we decide to leave it as the final option as we weren\u0026rsquo;t really prepared for it! Later we get to know that these were probably constructed by the Buddhists. The veracity of this is yet to be known though.\nClimb up the fort:\nReminded of our final goal and the deadline, we move over with heavy hearts and start climbing. Fortunately from here we manage to find the right path. A bit ahead we encounter Ram Kaka. This old man was from the Rajmachi village that is at the base of the rajmachi hillock and he climbs down to the Kondivide village EVERY day to sell buttermilk! Just a few minutes and we\u0026rsquo;re into think conversation. In about thirty minutes we reach the base village at Rajmachi. A refreshing Poha with a peppy hot masala tea and we\u0026rsquo;re all set to head for Rajmachi. All spruced up we head for the fort. We walk for about two kilometers unmindful of the path ahead. The splintering rain, shallow puddles with slimy murky waters kept us way too busy! After about a forty five minute walk, the path bifurcates into two. This is when we\u0026rsquo;re suddenly reminded that we were supposed to take a left just moments after we leave the village. Damn! We nuts have been walking towards lonawala for the past forty five minutes with absolutely no idea where we were heading to! A quick retreat to the base village and we finally find the path to the fort. Half way up the rajmachi hillock, you come to a temple. From here there are two routes - each one takes you to a different fort - Shrivardan and Manoranjan.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been close to about four years that I\u0026rsquo;ve visited a temple by interest. For some reason, I walk into it. Even now, I\u0026rsquo;ve no idea what diety exists in it or for that instance what it\u0026rsquo;s famous for. As I get out of it and look ahead, the mist suddenly happens to clear up and I get to see the phenomenal height of one of the forts and that meant miles to go before you could drop :-) ! It started raining heavily as we started the ascent. What made things more interesting was that we had streams flowing from the top of the hill. The sound of water rumbling down the hill and the chilled breeze swooning across your ears amidst those dense clouds is something that\u0026rsquo;ll get you moving even when things look a bit dicey! Surprisingly, climb up the fort wasn\u0026rsquo;t that difficult as it looked.\nHiking back to Lonavala\nAt about 4:00pm we start our descent to the village and manage to reach Ram Kaka\u0026rsquo;s place by around 4:30pm. Spicy thali was served almost instantly and after another bout of hot tea we decide to trek down towards lonavala. We could have as well got back to Karjat through the same way we\u0026rsquo;d come but doing that at dusk would probably be inviting deep trouble. Besides, we had just one torch and getting lost in the dense forest was something we wanted to avoid. Ram kaka was of the opinion that the Rajmachi - lonavala route was just a plain 3.5 hrs stretched out walk. We leave the hotel at about 5:15pm and the walk back looked pretty simple as promised. About an hour into the walk, we get to meet a group of people moving towards Rajmachi. When asked about the time estimate to reach lonavala, they said it would take us about two and a half hours. We walk further. Again after an hour or so , we encounter another small group. To our surprise the time estimate was made three hours! If what they said was right, we thought we could as well pull the brakes and try looking for a spot to rest for the night! Our instincts get us going and we keep meeting people, each one giving his own version! The hike back to lonavala is extremely simple . Just a bit of endurance and you\u0026rsquo;ll have a beautiful scenic walk. There\u0026rsquo;s this particular spot wherein you need to cross a gushing river in about knee deep water. The close to freezing water literally removes all the pain in your muscles and gets you moving faster! By about 7:45 pm we finally manage to get sight of the lonavala city. A few yards ahead and just as we\u0026rsquo;re about to feel a bit relaxed, a Y fort turns up! Damn, these Y junctions! We\u0026rsquo;ve had enough of descision making all through the day that we finally decide to arbitrarily chose one and try our luck. Later we\u0026rsquo;d come to know that had we moved in the direction we chose, we\u0026rsquo;d be reaching Lonavala but would be covering another 14kms extra. A couple of night gaurds fortunately get to us and redirect us in the right path. At about 08:00pm we encounter a couple who had just started their night trek towards Rajmachi. The guy says we\u0026rsquo;d need to walk twenty or so minutes to reach a village and from there we could get tempos to lonavala. The walk goes on and on. Suhas has sapped all his energy and is in no position to handle any more strain. We finally make it to the village but to our dismay they\u0026rsquo;re no tum-tum\u0026rsquo;s visible. With no option left, we continue walking . Round the corner a milkman pops and when asked the distance to lonavala, he says - Bas sab, sirf dus kilometer aagae hai. Akhilesh goes ecstatic with the expression on Suhas\u0026rsquo;s face All of us are equally tired and totally fatigued! I plug in my neckphone to my ears and keep walking, least bothered about the distance to cover. What other option did we have? The path zigzagged and Suhas sways similarly from one foot to another . In fact looking back now, I guess he was the source of inspiration to all of us. Finally at about 08:50pm we get sight of a tarred road. Few yards ahead we manage to pick a rick to drop us at Lonavala station.\nAt about 09:25pm we manage to reach the station. The next local was at 09:45 pm so we did have some time to relax. Once in the train as we remove our socks, we get to see the toll that the 40+ kms trek and the incessant rain had on us. Drenched from top to bottom and stinking from every corner as we hit the wooden seats in the train, other way-farers give us a sheepish look. Who cares? All that mattered was that we were in a train back and this time none of us were guiding the others to misguide, There were no more Y forks and the best part was that the lead knew the destination.\nNow if you ask me - All this struggle and trouble on a weekend , Was it all worth it ? I\u0026rsquo;ve no answer to that question. I\u0026rsquo;ll let the pictures do the talking!\n[/fruitful_tab]\n[fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Hike Planning\u0026rdquo;]\nTeam count : 05\nRoute: Route1 : Shivaji Nagar \u0026gt; Karjat \u0026gt; Khandpe \u0026gt; Kondividi \u0026gt; Kondane \u0026gt; Rajmachi village \u0026gt; Rajmachi fort [Relatively difficult] | Route 2: Shivaji Nagar \u0026gt; Lonavala station \u0026gt; Tungarli \u0026gt; Pambola village \u0026raquo;Rajmachi\nDistance: Route1: Karjat -\u0026gt; Kondividi:~15kms, Kondividi -\u0026gt; Kondana: ~2kms, Kondana-\u0026gt;Rajmachi peak : ~14kms [Hill climb] | Route 2: Lonavala -\u0026gt; Rajmachi : ~20kms [Simple]\nAltitude: ~2100 FT above MSL\nEndurance: Medium | Difficulty : Low / Medium based on route\nTime : Karjat-Kondividi : 20mins.

There were about eight of us and we weren\u0026rsquo;t really sure how many would fancy biking to the base. With all this, Muralgad as this weekend\u0026rsquo;s destination didn\u0026rsquo;t sound that interesting! I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether it was me or Vaibhav who brought about the idea of changing the plan and getting Abhishek to agree on Torna instead. Couple of minutes later, Dhok sends out a mail to the Deccan Highlander group and by about 06:00pm the count stood at 7. Later, I get to know from Suhas, Dhok received a solid dose from him for changing the plan. I\u0026rsquo;ll let Vaibhav take that honorable priviledge :-) .\nJuly 19th\n5:00 am as the regular Continental music wakes me up, I\u0026rsquo;m up in seconds. After the Katraj - Sinhagad trek, this was one of the first monsoon treks that fell in the medium difficulty category and besides, who\u0026rsquo;d want to miss the oppurtunity of trekking to a place that was approx. 4,600ft above MSL? Ashutosh, Sourabh, Omkar, Vaibhav and I reach Swargate at about 6:30 am. Abhshek Dhok by call, lets us know that he and Abhijeet would be joining us in a couple of minutes. The next bus to Vehli - the base village for Torna, was at 07:30am so we decide to have a quick breakfast at a nearby restaurant. Just as we start moving, Uwaraj and Swarnika pop in from nowhere with their ever smiling faces. Finally we\u0026rsquo;re 9!\nWe\u0026rsquo;re well ahead of time for the 7:30 am bus service. As the bus arrives and people board, we realise they\u0026rsquo;re not many takers to Vehli. In a way, I\u0026rsquo;m surprised. Torna is quite a famous destination for weekend treks and today it looks like we\u0026rsquo;re the only group all set to explore it. The first half of the 65 kms journey goes pretty somber with not much activity from anyone. Soon we hit upon playing Dumb charades and from then the journey gets interesting with people struggling to enact stuff; What with Uwaraj and Swarnika coming with the wierdest movie names!\nAt about 09:00am, the one and a half hour journey comes to an end and we reach Vehli. Two of Vaibhav\u0026rsquo;s friends were to join us at the base from Pune. They\u0026rsquo;d left from Sus road on a bike and were soon expected to reach there. As we wait for them for about fifteen minutes, Vaibhav and Dhok dole out spirit tales of various forts of Shivaji. There\u0026rsquo;s a belief that the Torna fort is haunted by a Brahmin Spirit who has issues with people staying on the fort overnight. Mythology has it that most of Shivaji\u0026rsquo;s forts have had human sacrifices to assuage the \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo;s that may be\u0026rsquo; to help them build the fort and maintain them. Before things got murkier and people started concocting wilder stories some noble soul decides to start the trek :-) !\nIn quest of the spirit\nVaibhav,having trekked this place more than thrice led the group. Right at the base, once you walk across the small village households you come across a small cascade where you get to experience that real rustic atmosphere. The sight of little kids joyously fluttering about in the slimy water takes you back to those carefree golden days! As you move further ahead, the hilly terrain begins and the path that you need to follow is more or less starkly demarcated. From the base the peak stands to your left, so somewhere up there you need to be taking a left and keep following the path. Ashutosh , Abhijeet and I somehow happened to trail behind and at one point realised there was a short cut up to a certain point. Our wild instinct gets the better of us and even before we decide logically, we\u0026rsquo;re amidst shrubs and bushes. The humus soil and the steep climb up make things quite interesting and we manage to reach a level plain about ten minutes ahead of the remaining folks. Omkar, Vaibhav, Dhok, Sourabh and Uwaraj soon get along while Swarnika leads from behind! A quick break there and we start moving along. There\u0026rsquo;s this particular spot enroute wherein you get to see the towering hillock right ahead of you, a deep valley just below your feet and a cascade at a far distance away. In a way emoting and reminding, where you scarcely fit in this whole huge maze.\nThe last thirty minutes of trek uphill is indeed pretty interesting. Though you do have railings to support you in case you miss a foot, you\u0026rsquo;d do pretty good by just scaling up the rocks without their support . This part would have been a bit risky had it rained. Nevertheless, it isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is too life threatening. The climb uphill lasted for about three hours and we managed to reach the top by 12:30 pm. About a quarter of an hour is spent in the temple courtyard and then we leave to explore the ramparts of the fort. Thankfully, the climate\u0026rsquo;s in for a swing and it gets pretty misty. At one end of the forts bulwarks you get to have an panoramic view of the Sahyadris. We literally could experience the clash of two clouds! Who even wants to be on cloud nine when you could as well be at a prospective point of electric discharge? Eh! A bit too far stretched but I bet you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have experience this even :-) .\nA few steps to that long arm!\nThere\u0026rsquo;s this particular spectacular spot wherein you get to have an extended view of the valley ahead of you. But for this, you had to get down a small iron ladder and then down some slippery rocks and walk a few yards around a narrow path to reach that spot. While Dhok and Omkar stood atop the rocks to give support to those of us who had interest to get down ; Abhishek , Vaibhav, Ashutosh and I trailed on the path a bit further only to get back as visibility was close to zero. The climb back to the rocky base and then up the ladder was probably the only risky and exhilarating part of the whole climb uphill.The Machi on the other side of the temple was pretty inviting too. You had to stoop on your knees and get to the other side of the Gaurd post. Probably this was one of the vital strike back point of those days.\nAt about 02:00pm we started the trek downhill. But for one particular spot which took a while to bypass the remaining stretch just required you to keep yourself on your feet and keep moving. We had a team of 150+ folks from Iflex who\u0026rsquo;d come to Torna that same day. Sadly, a few among them had dropped the waste after having their packed lunch. Abhijeet and Dhok happened to notice this and almost half way through the organisers of the ICE team had been at the receiving end !\nHad a great time sprinting down the second half of the peak. The thrilling experience of not being bothered about the final destination but just being worried of where to keep the next step and deciding everything and orchestrating it to your muscles in nanoseconds is what I guess keeps me on my toes every weekend.\nAt about 4:00pm we hit the base. We\u0026rsquo;d arranged for food for the nine of us at a small restaurant at the base before we started our trek. From the restaurant owner we get to know that the next bus to Pune was at 4:30 which was supposed to leave at 4:45pm. So all of us have a quick lunch and we head back to the stop. Surprisingly, Abhijeet and Omkar had just spoken to a Sumo driver to get us to Pune. The nine of us and four others hunch into a Sumo and head back home! I doze off to glory and by the time I get back to my senses, we almost reach Swargate.\n[/fruitful_tab] [fruitful_tab title=\u0026ldquo;Hike Details\u0026rdquo;]\nTeam : 09\nRoute: Swargate \u0026gt; Old Katraj \u0026gt; Bhor \u0026gt; VelhI village \u0026gt; Torna\nDistance: 65kms\nAltitude: ~4,600 FT above MSL\nTime : Uphill: 3hrs | Downhill:2 hrs [Monsoon]\nTransport: Swargate - VelhI [ ST: 06:30am, 07:30am ] | VelhI - Swargate [ ST: 04:30pm, 05:30pm ].\nExpenses: Rs 150 Approx.\n**Stay:**One day / Overnight [ Accommodation available in temple - Believe you\u0026rsquo;ve got to take the keys from the base village]\nBest time to visit: Monsoon!\nEndurance: low | Difficulty : Medium\nMisc.

Almost instantly I decide to re-plan this weekends trip to this place instead of the Raigad trek. A few minutes later, as I get out of the instantaneous glory; intelligence looms and I realise that the Hyd folks would screw me real bad had any more changes been made! Just a day back I\u0026rsquo;d changed the previous plan of the Lohgad-Visapur trek to Raigad as the previous one had very few takers initially.\n11th July:\nAs with most of the Deccan Highlander treks, At about 3:30 pm , Rahul sent out a final mailer having details of the almost finalised list of people who\u0026rsquo;d be joining us for the trek from Pune the next day. Rahul, Vishal, Uwaraj, Ashutosh kumar, Deepak, Nikunj, Amrapali and Ashutosh Dhobhal had been with us for a couple of previous treks. Sneha , Sumitra, Sourabh and Sandilya were the new ones to the group. From HydVentura, we had six folks - Hemant, Varaprasad, Abhishek, Raghu, Deepthi and Khushal who\u0026rsquo;d be pitching in early in the morning the next day. Santosh was traveling all the way from Bangalore ( a cool 16hrs! ) for this trek. This was going to be our first ever night camping trek for this monsoon season and we had 20 people aready!\n12th July\nSantosh wakes me up at about 05:45 am by a call telling me that he\u0026rsquo;d already reached Swargate and would be at Parihar chowk in a few minutes. The Hyd folks arrive at my place at about 07:05 am. The moment they put a foot in my house, I get behind their back prodding them to get ready quickly as we had a bus service to Mahad at 08:00am. Abhishek, Khushal, Santosh and Varaprasad leave as soon as they get ready. Soon Hemant, Raghu, Deepthi and I leave at about 8:00am. We\u0026rsquo;d just missed the 08:15 bus too and I could sense fumes out of Rahul\u0026rsquo;s ears as he kept calling, enquiring the status quo every five minutes. I prefer two positions while trekking - either the lead or the sweep. Most of the times, I end up being the sweep and this time I was sweeping even before we boarded the bus! I was the last one to arrive at Swargate and you could guess the emotions on people\u0026rsquo;s faces as I gave that royal entry :-) .\nTo reach Raigad, one has to reach the Pachad village which is about 20kms from the easily accessible Mahad Village. Mahad is about 120kms from Pune ( Swargate ). Fortunately we had the next bus at about 09:00am. After a four hour long scenic journey through the Katraj-Bhor-Varandha route we reach Mahad at about 01:30pm. The next bus to Pachad was at about 2:00pm. Monsoon and high altitude, makes this route all the more beautiful with cascades at almost every bend and the ghat road adds to the breathtaking view of the Sahyadris. At 3:00pm we reach Pachad and from there manage to reach the base of Raigad in about 10 minutes. Nikunj and Rahul had been to this place before and they\u0026rsquo;d managed to find an awesome cave right behind the shop a bit up the hill. At that spot you would feel as if you\u0026rsquo;re inside a skull of a demon which was overlooking the village. Gusty winds whining through the two holes of the cave and exiting from the other side sort of revitalizes you. Indeed a beautiful spot and is a must visit if you ever plan to be to Raigad. The climb up the Raigad hill is just a climb up a flight of about 1500 steps, with a few long stretches here and there.\nThe Climb uphill\nWe had planned for lunch at a shop at the base but were compelled to be satisfied with Misal Pav. For some reason he wasn\u0026rsquo;t serving Thalli\u0026rsquo;s that day. At about 03:45pm we start the climb. The estimated time for the climb as put in various blogs and sites was about three hours. So right from the base we tried our best in keeping people on their toes all the time . Little did we know that, that timing was put for a dry season trek. An old woman sells sherbat and lemon juice at about 200feet from the base and you do have stalls which would probably be open during Summer. Half way up the hill you have a stupendous waterfall towering at about twenty five feet. We spend quite some time here and then move up to the peak. As you climb up the steps , you gain ascent very quickly and the look of the valley with the winding roads and mist filled atmosphere only gets more panoramic with every step.The visibility margin fades as you reach the peak and you can hardly look beyond a few feets ahead. Even before we realise that we\u0026rsquo;re reached the top , in about close to two hours we manage to reach the shed that has been constructed by MTDC for visitors. You do have a couple of guest houses but this would do good as much. We junk our bags here and leave to explore the fort.\nUnknowingly we split\nWith real low visibility we fail to keep pace and happen to divide into two groups. Rahul, Nikunj, Vishal, Amarpali, Sneha, Sumitra and Uwaraj moved ahead while the rest of us for some reason failed to trail. Hemant, Sandilya, Deepak, Abhishek, Santosh, Raghu, Deepthi, Sourabh, Varaprasad, Ashutosh Kumar, Khushal and I start exploring the various chambers. We spend quite some time in the Queen\u0026rsquo;s quarters doing all sort of RDB jumps and keep clicking around. Ashutosh Dhobhal finds his way and joins us from nowhere. He\u0026rsquo;d wandered to the other side but somehow happened to listen to our howls and managed to track us. As we keep walking ahead we reach a dead end. This is when we wonder where the couple who were walking ahead of us vanished all of a sudden. We\u0026rsquo;d heard rumors of spirits existing up there and thanks to Ashutosh , Deepak and Sandilya things got lot peppier :-) . Fortunately, somewhere near the ropeway we manage to find someone who guided us in the right direction. We find our way back and then enter the ramparts of Shivaji Maharaj\u0026rsquo;s quarters. Quite close to Shivaji\u0026rsquo;s Durbar we happen to meet the other group. They\u0026rsquo;d seen that part of the fort already so we decide to meet at the shed at 09:00pm. Rahul warns us of close to zero visibility near Takmaktok and Nikunj suggested we avoid getting anywhere close to that spot.\nAvenue des Champs-Élysées\nIt\u0026rsquo;s around 07:30pm and there\u0026rsquo;s still light all around. Soon in a few minutes it gets dark and the lights are switched on. The dense mist makes the light diffuse out totally and all that you are left with is the moonlight and the torches in your hand to guide you. We explore Shivaji\u0026rsquo;s chamber\u0026rsquo;s and his durbar. The spread out durbar, the long pathways and the towering entrance to the Durbar with Mist all around gives you a feeling that you\u0026rsquo;re on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris . Besides this place I\u0026rsquo;ve heard is also famous for it\u0026rsquo;s amazing acoustics. Wonder how people in those ages managed to build such magnificent buildings!\nWe wander through the supposed Bazar of those days and finally reach the Takmak Tok spot ( Execution point) . Sandilya gets ecstatic and reasons out to pay it a visit. We somehow manage to stop him and proceed to the Samadhi of Sivaji. It was about 08:30pm by then and we decide to get back to the Shed. Way back, Deepak and Sandilya plan to get back to Takmak tok at 01:00am :-) .\nCamp at base\nRahul and Nikunj had spoken to the attender there to cook food for the twenty of us. Food was ready by the time we hit the spot and after a sumptuous meal we get back to the shed. A huge mattress was provided by the attender at the cost of some self praise and finally after a quick change we hit the floor. To while away time we hit upon Antakshari which went on till about 12:30 am. Not to mention, it was stopped because the manager got pissed real bad listening to us bray with our mighty vocal chords and when he could barely manage anymore we thought it would only be wise to stop :-) .\nI wonder what we would have done had we not got this place to rest. It rained cats n dogs all through the night. Sandilya was all the while relating it to bullets in a warzone and we also had one spirited soul who kept snoring away in glory. A dog gave us consistent company and Sr. Pinto on an onsite deputation from HSBC made his way under Santosh and a couple of other folks late at night :-) .\n13th July:\nAt about 05:30 am I\u0026rsquo;m woken up by Nikunj and Vishal scurrying around for something. I soon follow steps and explore nature with a bottle of water . Later as we get back to the shed we get to know there were restrooms available a few yards away :-) .\nHemant and Varaprasad had to board their train at 4:30pm from Pune. So we decided to leave for the base as early as possible. Soon we were about 13 of us who decided to trek downhill (?) and and the remaining seven stayed back to explore more of the fort. In about 45 minutes we hit the base. From there we arranged for a Sumo to drop us at Mahad directly. We reached Mahad at about 10:30am and from there boarded a bus to Bhor. The bus was pretty much empty and the 2.5 hr journey was quickly spent with dumb charades. From Bhor another bus got us to Swargate by around 3:00pm. Hemant and Varaprasad left for the Station while the rest of us hit back home.\nRahul and Co. I understand from Vishal , had been to Takmak tok and explored more of the fort. They\u0026rsquo;d got back at about 5:00pm . Reports from them yet awaited ;-) .\nA long story cut short - An awesome place to be for a morning climb up the hill. A longer stay up the hill would do good given the long travel that you need to do reach there. And oh yes!

Infy was never my dream company - In fact I fail to admire any IT company. I never had a role model in the IT industry, neither do i have one now. It just happened to be the first option in hand. Infy was the first and only job interview I\u0026rsquo;d attended and oh yeah, the tag name mattered then and besides, at that point I had no other options open .\nToday, as I tick off the 365th day as an IT engineer, I see nothing really magnificient that I\u0026rsquo;ve achieved professionally. I\u0026rsquo;m just one out of those umpteen number of software engineers strewn all across India, sitting in front of the LCD screens trying best to reolve tickets, meet deadlines, work on codes and prepare patches. They\u0026rsquo;ve been days when I wondered where my contribution falls into place in this whole big maze only to realise, all that I\u0026rsquo;m doing is donkey work. Every third engineer does what I\u0026rsquo;m doing! There\u0026rsquo;s no stark differentiating factor. Not a single person\u0026rsquo;s life is directly affected by what i do day in and day out. What\u0026rsquo;s the point looking for Onsite oppurtunities when you know you\u0026rsquo;d be screwed day in and day out at the Onsite location? Where you don\u0026rsquo;t get to enjoy even your weekends properly? It\u0026rsquo;s all a mad race to satisfy the person governing your monthly check. They elude you with rewards, opportunities and finally when it looms in your head that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more left in life to do, you get your next appraisal.\nAll that said, there\u0026rsquo;s no denying to the fact that the work culture in Infy is stupendous. I got a platform to network real well, a place to vent my thoughts to the higher management as and when the need arose, a place to increase the scope of my Extra-curriculars. I\u0026rsquo;ve started clubs, joined groups, built up on my french, strummed the chords, built up on my hobbies, grown socially conscious, learnt mannerisms on the way and what not?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been receiving group congratulation mails right from the time I opened my Outlook today at office. But I still fail to realise what exactly the celebration is for? All it finally means to me is a small increase in my pay package and oh Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m no more legally bond to the company.\nProbably I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing something starkly different next year or for all you know still be eluded by the mirage of recognition all the way lamenting \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo;est la Vie \u0026rsquo; and keep moving.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/07/09/the-it-mirage/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFive months of training, one month of quasi-bench, three months on a tool, three months into Prod Support and with this comes to an end , just another year in my professional career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never had to choose what was good for me.

Why don\u0026rsquo;t they have a lot many more National Holidays?\nThe last week had been been pretty stuffed up with tickets and deadlines. And damn! Murphy\u0026rsquo;s always right - they pop up right at the moment you need to leave. Thanks to the American Independence day, this friday was a paid holiday. A much needed break!\nDone with some mundane work, I sift through BBC to catch up with some news.Sometime at around 4:00pm the much awaited mail from Rahul arrives - The latest count was 23! This trek was going to be a bit different. The positive response was probably because of the emphasis that was laid on the simplicity of the trek and the late start timing that was decided - But for a few nuts, who would like to wake up early on a saturday morning? ;)\nJuly 5th:\nMy Desktop back home\u0026rsquo;s been giving some trouble. Even at around 3:00am I\u0026rsquo;m still left clueless as to what the issue could have been due to. I finally give-up at around 3:30am and hit the bed. At 6:30am I drag myself out of the bed, the regular set of Saturday wake up calls and I rush to get ready. We\u0026rsquo;d to reach SivajiNagar station by 7:30am, the latest. Most of us reach happen to reach on time. The count at the station grew up to 25 after a final set of additions and deletions.At about 08:00 am all of us hunched into the local.\nWe finally manage to reach Lonavala at about 09:30 am.A quick breakfast in a shop quite close to the station and all of us seemed to be set for the trek. This time we had showers right from the start. A group of 25, called for arranging a tempo/mazda. While Rahul, Abhijeeth, Vaibhav and a couple of others were busy deliberating with the drivers, the rest of us whiled away time on the road. Finally they came to an agreement of 1.5 grand up and down. The only downside(?) being a few of us would be travelling in a mini goods truck :-) . Nikunj, Vaibhav, Suhas, Bhavna, Amrita, Monica, Amrapali, Apeksha,Nisha and Manasa took the elite class ride ;-) in a Sumo . The rest of us hurled ourselves into the truck. Being the last to get into the truck, Abhijeeth and I had the royal privilege to stand on the support stand at the rear of the truck ! Small deeds that make the trip worth remembering :-) .\nTo the Basepoint\nIdeally, had you been in a small group you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to take a Bus to the Shivapura village which is about 25kms from Lonavala town and start the trek from there. But then again you\u0026rsquo;d have to check for the bus timings and probably start a bit early from the town. The road connecting Lonavala town and Shivapura village and further down the Sahara city has been maintained exceptionally well. As you gradually gain ascent up the winding roads, you\u0026rsquo;d be literally driving through the clouds. A shower with varying intensity always gives you company almost all the way through. Enroute you get to see quite a few cascades. If you\u0026rsquo;re coming down with you\u0026rsquo;re family, Bunshi Dam and Tiger point would probably be spots which you\u0026rsquo;d like to visit en-route.\nThe walk uphill and the uninvited Guest\nThe Koraigad peak looks highly challenging when seen from the base. But believe me, even my four year old niece would easily tarot up the peak! A path to the left from the base point takes you up to a small tableland and from there you just need to follow the path. If you\u0026rsquo;re fortunate enough, you could get to walk through streams that flow from the peak. About 20 minutes into the walk you\u0026rsquo;d be seeing steps up to the fort and from then on it\u0026rsquo;s just about running uphill. Even before you realise the distance you\u0026rsquo;ve covered, you\u0026rsquo;d be 3,000 Ft above MSL. There\u0026rsquo;s pretty much scope of avoiding the well formed path and climbing up a few rocky patches - That ways you get to gain ground pretty quick and would as well add some fun and spice to the trip. Be forewarned! We did happen to spot a snake en-route . I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure who spotted it, but we definitely enjoyed the company for a while :-) .\nOnce you reach the peak you realise how deceiving the fort looks from the base. I was expecting to see a small strip of land and nothing more than that. But there was a lot more in store - A vastly spread out table land with a couple of decenly big fresh water ponds and thankfully, they were not even remotely spoilt! A pond looms right as you hit to the peak. A quick walk across the bastions and you\u0026rsquo;d soon be invited another small pond. With no second thoughts, Abhijeet and I jumped into it in full attire - shorts, t-shirts and shoes :-) . We were already wet and probably that would also clean up the clothes a bit ;-) . Soon most of the group joined us from the other side and we did spend quite some time in there. Had real fun plummeting each other into the water. Swimming in that ice cold water with it raining heavily is one of those moments which i\u0026rsquo;d take back as a sweet memoir. Most of us were out of the pool in about half an hour. This is when It struck to me to remind Abhijeet to get Bhavna singing the \u0026lsquo;Ek thithli\u0026rsquo; song. Way back in the truck, Rahul had mentioned she knew the song pretty well and it was up to us to get her singing. I winked at Abhijeet as he came out of water and soon He, Rahul and co. got her to sing. Was real fun listening to it and surprisingly she seemed to remember each and every word of it! Boy, Doordarshan days!!\nTiger point? Huh\nWe soon started our way down the hill and reached the base point in about twenty minutes. A round of tea at the base and we moved over to Tiger point. This is nothing more than another scenic spot blissfully spoilt by the public. Makes me wonder what\u0026rsquo;s the point in even visiting the spot to enjoy the scenery aheadnwhen you\u0026rsquo;re dirtying the ground on which you stand? We moved out of this place in a few minutes and left for Bunshi dam. The crowd was real thick here, so most of us instantly dropped the idea of visiting it. Abhijeet, Vishal, Hari and Vishnu decided to give it a shot and moved ahead. They did have a good time there though. The rest of us hit to a stall and satiated the long deprived rats in our stomachs with Kandha bhajji, Misal pav and Vada pav.\nMoments after the remaining four folks arrived and changed, we decided to leave the place and get back to lonavala to catch the 5:30 train. We\u0026rsquo;d sent back the Sumo, So all 25 of us got into the truck. In about fifteen minutes we\u0026rsquo;d reached the town. Since we had to catch a train, most of the group left for the station as soon as we got down. Abhijeeth, Rahul, Vaibhav, Omkar and I held back to settle the bill. The driver started demanding 100 bucks extra for no reason at all and soon we picked up a quarell with him. Fortunately we had Vaibhav, Abhijeet and Omkar to help us with the Marathi. At one point of time , thinking that we\u0026rsquo;d take the bait, the owner said he didn\u0026rsquo;t want the remainig 700 bucks too. Omkar grabbed the oppurtunity and walked away with the money :-) . All of us shamelessly followed. This is when the driver followed us and requested to give back the 700 bucks. In no mood to quarrel further, we gave him the appropriate amount and got to the station.\nAnd Someone just said, Get me those tickets!\nIn the station there was another episode yet to happen! In the morning, I\u0026rsquo;dasked amit to purchase tickets to Lonavala. I\u0026rsquo;d totally forgot about the return. But for eight of us the rest had tickets now. There was only about a minute left for the departure when Abhijeet and I decided to give it one final shot. Rahul handed us over the cash and both of us started a quick sprint to the other platform. Sprint is too small a word! I\u0026rsquo;ve never ran that fast till date :-) . In fact I could literally feel my calf muscles rebounding and the ligaments strenuously pulling up to meet with the pace. Probably this is what is called running on thin air! We managed to buy the tickets and get back to the platform only to see the train moving away from our sight. Was a close call! Probably had we not missed time initially, we would have made it. Nevertheless, we did get comfortable seats in the 6:25 local and reached home pretty comfortably!\nA sweet simple trek to enjoys nature\u0026rsquo;s bounty.

I seem to be the last person to wake up this time! Ideally Suhas was to drop by my house at around 3:30 am after his night shift. When my alarm hoots at 4:45 am, I sense the first drop out for the trek. I anxiously dial his number only to hear that he\u0026rsquo;d be reaching my house in a few minutes. The routine starts again. The next person on the roll was Rahul- someone well known in our group to doze in mighty glory when his presense is really required. Quite surprisingly, today he picks the call right at the first ring and he pretty much sounded alert enough. So i move on to the next person - Amrita. The call goes on but no one picks. A few minutes later she calls back telling me that even she was very much awake. Ashutosh too was almost set and he\u0026rsquo;d be reaching Parihar chowk in a couple of minutes.We\u0026rsquo;d to reach Shivaji Nagar Stn. by around 6:00 am to board the train to Karjat.\nAt about 05:35am Ashutosh, Suhas, and I meet Amrita at Parihar Chowk and we pick a rick. to Kadki stn. Suhas suggested, that would be closer and that the Sinhagad express would stop there as well. We happen to reach well before time . The train would tentatively reach Kadki at about 06:20am. Rahul and a couple of folks would be boarding the train at Shivaji Nagar and a few others would be joining enroute. Later as Bhavana boards the train we get wind of an interesting episode. Pragya Joshi had overslept and Abhijeet too had to miss the train - For ten minutes Abhijeet\u0026rsquo;s been at the door of Pragya\u0026rsquo;s house trying to wake her up while Bhavana was seated in a rick below. One of the tickets were on Bhavana\u0026rsquo;s name, so she had to make it to the station at any cost. And she did, as Rahul describes later - The \u0026lsquo;Jab we met style :-) !\nThis time the final count was 13. Rahul, Bhavana, Kajal, Abhilasha, Trupti, Suhas, Amrita, Ashutosh, Uwaraj, Swarnika, Abhijeet, Pragya, and I. At about 08:15am we reach Karjat.The latest update of Abhijeet and Pragya was from Amritha - They\u0026rsquo;d boarded a ST and would be reaching a BIT late. We decide to move further and wait at Ambivali for the two. To reach the trek base one needs to reach Ambivalli and from there walk some distance to the Peth Village.\nStart of the trek\nA five minute walk to the Karjat bus stand and we get to the know the next service to Ambivalli would be at 08:30am. The following service would be at 09:45am.But again you would have to get down at Kasheli and get hold of a TumTum to reach Ambivilli. We get some VadaPav\u0026rsquo;s packed and simultaneously inform the details of the bus timings to Abhijeet.In about an hour we happen to reach Ambivalli. The best identification mark for this stop is a small school to the left side,right at the starting of the Ambivalli village. A cement path to the right takes you to the Peth village.\nA few other groups had also arrived by then and were sort of relaxing at the tea shop. The latest status quo from Abhijeet was that they\u0026rsquo;d got down at Khopoli and had picked another service to Ambivalli. A few minutes later we get a call from him telling us that they\u0026rsquo;d just got down at Ambivalli village and were standing right in front of a school - the irony being that, we were standing in front of a school too but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t trace them out. A deeper analysis ;-) by Rahul reveals that from Khopoli they\u0026rsquo;d actually caught a bus to Amboli village and not Ambivalli village . How better can things get :-) ?\nWe decide to move on, reach Peth village and wait for them. Ideally the walk is about an hours quick sprint. In our case though, we took a sweet two hours to reach the village - thanks to the stop over at one of the viewpoints and the quick pace of most of us :-) . Nevertheless, it was a beautiful start; what with us trying out all possible short cuts, avoiding the regular route. Also we had a heavy downpour for a few minutes as we reached the village - a much deserved respite post the humid weather.\nFirst sighting of the fort\nOnce you cover about half of the distance from the Ambivalli village you get to see the Kothaligad fort from the breath taking viewspot . You need to take an escalated embankement path to the left, a couple of minutes after you start from the Ambivilli village. Once here, it\u0026rsquo;s only about following the well laid kutcha path and reaching the Peth village. Oh and If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a couple of short cuts - they\u0026rsquo;re plenty. It\u0026rsquo;s all up to you to use your brains and instincts to concort a path from the wilderness!\nSomewhere when we were still on our way to Peth, my cell manages to catch the signal and a message is delivered - Abhikeet and Pragya are on their way to Mumbai :-) . Getting to Ambivalli from Amboli was something that they decided against. Quite reasonable a decision!\nWe reach the Peth village base at about 12:30pm. There\u0026rsquo;s a small hotel types place here wherein you can have a brief stop over for a light snack or tea. Uwaraj and Swarnika catch up with us here at this spot. We get to know that they\u0026rsquo;d not taken the left and instead moved further into the village right at the beginning :-) ! Each of us have a shot of hot diluted masala tea and start moving towards the Kothaligad fort. Our pace was pretty fast from here - probably the masala tea did the trick on the drenched nuts :-) ! The villagers directed us at a certain point and from there the trek up was all a quickly guessed out route. We did have a loyal dog to guide us to a certain distance but soon even he ditched us once another doggie wagged her tail!\nHalf way through the way up the hillock and half the fuses are out. This was Amritha\u0026rsquo;s first ever trek and she was already cursing all of us mentally for having moved up with that pace. Abhilasha and Swarnika were more of less in the same thought process probably! They definitely did test our motivation skills at aone point of time :-) ! Finally we made it to a plateau and now all that was left was to climb up the final part of the fort. This did look a bit steep. Suhas , Uwaraj and Ashutosh tried exploring the possibilities on one side and Rahul and I on the other side. There was no way up! Damn and the way down for us was far worse. We somehow managed to get back to the plateau and rested there for a while. Intermittent showers and the haily winds kept the spirits up though. We started our down trek in about fifteen minutes and by around 3:00pm we reaached the Village.\nAnd we thought we were there!\nFrom there, as we turned back and looked at the height we\u0026rsquo;d covered and the spot that we\u0026rsquo;d got stuck up, a major disappointment loomed on our faces. We\u0026rsquo;d not even reached the base of the Kothaligad fort. All that we\u0026rsquo;d covered was the base foundation of the fort. The chap from the hotel then told us that we\u0026rsquo;d chosen the wrong path at a spot - Instead of taking a left we morons had moved rightwards. This is when Uwaraj, Swarnika and Ashutosh suggested we give the trek another shot. We quickly had a poll on who\u0026rsquo;d like to move up again and after having got a 50:50 status decided to split. Rahul would accompany Bhavna, Kajal, Abjilasha,Trupti and Amrita back to Karjat and Suhas, Ashutosh,Uwaraj, Swarnika and I would give the Kothaligad another shot again. The only dicey thing was that we\u0026rsquo;ll have to make it QUICK! If we had to target boarding the 6:30 train at Karjat, we\u0026rsquo;d have to scoop all our energy and move fast, real fast. The return bus to Karjat from Ambivalli would leave at 5:30pm. We hit up on reaching the peak in 1 hour. Swarnika ;-) led the group all the way to the top! This time we took the left turn at the right spot and we had two kids and our ever faithful dog to show us the path. The way up was real good. You had to reach the first plateau and from there take a flight of stairs up the caves to reach the forts bulwarks.This path was pretty much simple and the caves part of the trek upwards was stupendous. Thanks to the constant chitter chatter of Swarnika, we managed to hit the top of the fort in flat 45 minutes. At the caves you have an old woman selling Lemon juice. I bet you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to miss this! We stayed on top for a while and to inform ;-) the first team that we\u0026rsquo;d reached the peak, messaged them. A brief photo session and we started our trek downwards. This was done in a jiffy - A sweet 15minute run down the mill :-) .A quick lunch here and at about 04:30pm started our trek down to the Ambivalli village. The dog led us all the way down to Ambivalli! Also we had Suhas to entertain us with his sliding on the brief cascades and oh yes, did I not tell you - he lost the strands of his shorts somewhere way down and had a Charlie chaplin run down the way ? Now Suhas, We do have a video to prove that, NOM :-) .\nMeeting deadlines!\nWe did manage to reach the Ambivalli base point right on time: 05:28pm. The 05:30 service was right on time and fortunately he dropped us right ahead of the Karjat station. The first team had been waiting there for a while and we managed to be right on time again to catch the 06:30 Deccan Queen way back to Pune. Once we reached Pune we decided to have dinner at a pretty famous restaurant at JM Road . A sumptuous dinner with people checking out all sorts of Maharashtrian delicacies. I tasted a yummyDosa types dish made of grounded grains. Well, I dont really remember the name of the dishes as Trupti was the one who ordered it and the Marathi jargon only complicated things :-) !\nThe Kothaligad trek has indeed been challenging. Not because of the endurance but because we had to redo it again! The strict deadlines made it all the more interesting. Probably this place needs a second visit sometime later; now that we know where to take a right left turn ;-) !\nStats:\nTrek:1 day trek\nMembers: 13\nRoute: Karjat-Ambivali-Peth village base-Kothaligad.\nBest season: Monsoon / Winter\nApproximate Time : Karjat to Ambivalli - 45mins; Ambivalli to Peth village trek - 1 hr quick sprint; Peth base to Kothaligad peak - 1hr ( Subject to the climate )\nEndurance: Medium\nDifficulty: Easy-Medium ( Based on route chosen)\nBus timings: 08:30 am - Karjat bus stand to Ambivalli; 05:30pm - Ambivalli to Karjat\nTrain timings: Sinhagad Express : 06:00am ( Pune Station ) ; Deccan Queen : 06:30pm ( Karjat Station )\nImportant:\nStick to schedules: Connectivity to and from the Peth village is pretty bleak.\nFOLLOW THE DOG: Atleast in this trek rely on the dog\u0026rsquo;s instinct.

I seem to be the last person to wake up this time! Ideally Suhas was to drop by my house at around 3:30 am after his night shift. When my alarm hoots at 4:45 am, I sense the first drop out for the trek. I anxiously dial his number only to hear that he\u0026rsquo;d be reaching my house in a few minutes. The routine starts again. The next person on the roll was Rahul- someone well known in our group to doze in mighty glory when his presense is really required. Quite surprisingly, today he picks the call right at the first ring and he pretty much sounded alert enough. So i move on to the next person - Amrita. The call goes on but no one picks. A few minutes later she calls back telling me that even she was very much awake. Ashutosh too was almost set and he\u0026rsquo;d be reaching Parihar chowk in a couple of minutes.We\u0026rsquo;d to reach Shivaji Nagar Stn. by around 6:00 am to board the train to Karjat.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Kothaligad trek (Peth)"},{"content":"Purushotam skews his head up and looks at the monitor.

I wonder what his mind is concocting in the vast expanse. I introduce myself and sit beside him. He\u0026rsquo;s faster than me in socializing. A few minutes and we\u0026rsquo;re discussing almost everything under the sun. Soon we strike a deal - He teaches me Marathi and I teach him English. Thoughts fly by his mouth in Hindi/Marathi but when it comes to English, he\u0026rsquo;s blacked out. Soon Shekar, Baaji rao and Preeti join the conversation. Shekar, BaajiRao and Uttam are pursuing their 12th grade at Fergusons and Garware College. Preeti has completed her MA in English and currently plans to do her M.Phil.\nBiswajeet and Aditya soon join us after having a quick chat with Purushotam\u0026rsquo;s Mom. Suddenly the topic of Indian independence pops up. When asked what they feel about the independence movement, Shekar is prompt in responding - India shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been given Independence. He reason\u0026rsquo;s out saying they would have been in a better position today had the British continued to stay. Point taken!\nThey\u0026rsquo;d just had a session with Dhananjay - A graduate from University of Pune. Most of it was in Marathi, so there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much that I understood. But their jubilant responses and the questions on career development takes me off my feet. They know where they need to be few years down the line. Much better planned that me! It\u0026rsquo;s only about how they work towards it that would decide how far they go towards reaching their goal.\nThese people had different interests and passions; were from different backgrounds, schools and colleges. Just one thing bonded them together - All were visually challenged! A few dyslexic and physically challenged too.\nJust two hours with them and you learn what life is all about. Believe me; they’ve seen things from a much better perspective than us. Every statement from their mouth makes me realize how little I was in front of them. They teach me - It\u0026rsquo;s not the vision that is important, what’s important is how you visualize it. They tell me, they\u0026rsquo;re no more afraid of darkness; all that they’re afraid of is light.\nAt 07:00pm as the class ends, Uttam requests us to show them the Infosys campus. I\u0026rsquo;m stumped! We promises to take them in the forthcoming weekends, bid goodbye and walk out. The sparkling smile on their faces as we shake hands and walk out still lingers in my mind. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a livelier smile than that till date - a smile of true thankfulness.\nAll that they were asking for was a few minutes of our time to see the world from a visionary perspective, to learn things from the so called fortunate people like us, to understand and reconfirm if what they\u0026rsquo;ve been visualizing in their abstract minds is actually what is present out there.\nAs I walk out of the old school building, I\u0026rsquo;m ashamed of things I\u0026rsquo;ve been so proud of till date. I\u0026rsquo;m belittled and humbled by the prowess that these people possess. There\u0026rsquo;s so much that we\u0026rsquo;ve lost sight of in our endless quest for a better life that we\u0026rsquo;ve lost track of the minute details of living a worthier life.\nIf you’re from Pune and can take some time off on your weekends, probably you may want to do some unlearning and pay a visit to the Snehankit foundation. For all you know, it\u0026rsquo;s we who are blind, light just being a camouflage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/06/23/in-quest-of-a-visionary-life/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePurushotam skews his head up and looks at the monitor.

So finally we decided to have two batches for the Sarasgad trek.\n21st June:\nSnehith had come down to my place the night before. We\u0026rsquo;re up by around 5:00am and start dialling numbers on the cell. A few enlightened souls were still asleep.. and they had to be woken up! Pranav\u0026rsquo;s already awake by the time I call him. Rahul still hangs in heavenly glory till about 6:10 am. About fourteen of Snehith\u0026rsquo;s friends were supposed to join us . All drop! Akhilesh arrives at the bus stand well before time. At about 06:25 I get a call from Nikunj saying he\u0026rsquo;d be joining us soon. Vaibhav, Siddharth and Trupti turn up at 06:30. Rahul\u0026rsquo;s surprising there at the Sivajinagar bus stand right on time! Finally we\u0026rsquo;re a team of 12 - Pankaj, Prashant Rathore :-) , Falgun , Nikunj, Vaibhav, Trupti, Siddharth, Pranav, Rahul, Snehith and I. Sivanand would be joining us enroute.\nWe initially had plans to take a bus to Khopoli first and then another to Pali. Vaibhav enquires with the transport officials and finds out that we\u0026rsquo;ve got a direct bus to Pali at 07:00am. The first half an hour, more or less everyone keeps to himself. Nevertheless a few minutes later most of us get to the rear of the bus and slowly start conversing. Probably it\u0026rsquo;s been just about ten minutes and wham..Someone ( read Nikunj) clears his throat and starts singing. Prashant falls in line soon. Melody turns to Rhapsody with most of us trying to pitch in whatever we know. People start staring at us but who cares! :-)\nIn about three hours, 10:20 hrs, the driver kicks us out of the bus. We\u0026rsquo;d reached Pali! Pali situated in the Sudhagad Taluk of the Raigad district is famous for Ballaleshvar - one of the Ashtavinayaks. A brief darshan at the temple followed by a quick breakfast and we\u0026rsquo;re all set for the trek. Localites guide us to the trek base point. From the base point, the trek looks pretty simple. JUst one hillock to cover. This looked just similar to the Rohida fort but for the steep incline at the end. At approx. 11:30 hrs we start the trek. Unfortunately, this time climate isn\u0026rsquo;t as conducive as it was during the Rohida trek. Air currents were sporadic and humidity was high. We reach a plateau and decide to rest for a while. Pranav on the other hand decides to stay right there instead of moving ahead. We were only four of us trailing behind in the group - Pranav, Rahul, Nikunkj and I - the rest had already reached a higher plateau. Amidst all this, Nikunj direly needed a band to pony his hair. All we had was a datacable :-) !\nIn moments we catchup with the remaining folks. All that was left to reach to the peak now was to climb up the vertical hillock. A flight of gigantic steps manually carved out of the rocks led us up to the top. The climb would have been scary had it rained :-) ! Once we reach the top by the stairs we realised, there was a little more to climb. This secton was a bit interesting - A few hairpin turns, slippery rock surfaces and loose gravel. In about 10minutes we reach the actual top. A small Nag temple stands isolated at a corner. We rest a while here by the side of the hillock which had relatively better air flow and then decide to start our downward trek. Pranav had already reached the base temple by this time.\nThe way down was a cakewalk. All you needed was impulsive feet, a bit of concentration, and control on your senses to zip down the hillock. Rain would definitely have added a silver line! By around 03:00pm we get back to the same old hotel where we had breakfast and have a decent lunch. The direct bus back to Pune was supposed to come at around 04:30pm. We reach the Pali bus stand by around 04:00pm and while away time.. Unfortunately, we\u0026rsquo;re not the only one\u0026rsquo;s waiting for the bus. The moment the bus turns into the bus stand, there\u0026rsquo;s a mad rush to catch a seat. Rahul manages to get a seat. Pankaj and Shivanand wisely jump into the drivers cabin and base themselves properly there. The rest of us stand! The prospects of getting a seat after Khopoli was also pretty bleak, so we decided to switch buses there.\nWe reach the Khopoli bus stand by around 05:45 pm. As we stand and decide on what to do next, a set of kids barely three years old starts begging for money and as Trupti pointed, all they knew to speak was \u0026lsquo;Paisa Paisa\u0026rsquo;. Probably that is all that they were taught! Their behaviour indeed showed they were mentally sick and it was high time they received attention. All of this in a small town like Pali. Imagine the plight of several other unlucky kids spread out all across the country. India is a developing Country - What part of it is developing is the question !\nAt about 6:15pm we picka bus to Lonavala and reach by about 7:00pm. At Lonavala we board the train at about 07:20pm and we\u0026rsquo;re back to form again - All of us squat on the floor and while away time by cracking highly intellectual PJ\u0026rsquo;s almost all the way back to Shivaji Nagar :-) . That one hour of chitter chatter indeed brought about a feeling that we\u0026rsquo;ve known each other for quite some time! We reach Pune at around 08:15pm and decide to have dinner and then part.\nA classic outing, subjective climate and on top of it all - a wonderful group.

Moving over from KT phase to Secondary support, solving stuff which seems simple but turns out to be worse than what it shouldn’t be, filling the same old excel sheets multiple times for reasons unknown even to the person who send it, needless formalities and processes just to send a message across to the person at the other side of the globe…Boy, Am I complaining?\nBelieve me, I’ve never worked this hard in the past few months! All this, just to make sure my work life doesn’t spoil my weekend. The Kundalika river rafting was planned for Sunday and the DH team had planned a series of treks starting this week. I’d decided that I’m not going to miss even a single trek. In fact, that’s one of the main reasons why I got myself transferred to Pune on a short term basis for!\n15th June\n01:20 hrs: I hit the bed after finishing some personal work. The day’s been real long and eventful and a proper sleep is all I need. The sound of water gushing through gorges and sound of rain drops spluttering all about is all that I hear and in moment’s I’m totally blacked out.\n05:00 hrs: The Continental music hoots from my mobile to remind me it’s time I get up. My back’s aching real bad and arm’s aren’t any good either. Yesterday’s 10kms of Oaring is slowly taking its toll. I snooze the alarm and get back to sleep. Fortunately, I realize the pain is only going to get worse if I rest longer. I Jump out of the bed and rush to the restroom.\nWe had to reach Swargate by 06:30, the latest. Ashutosh, Hitanshu – my roommate and Akhilesh - a friend of his would be joining me from Aundh. Vaibhav, Siddharth, and Rahul Nair, were to join us at Swargate. I call up Rahul and Ashutosh to wake them up. Rahul wasn’t really sure if he’d join us. Ashutosh said he’d be meeting us at Bremar circle. We leave for Swargate by around 5:50 and reach right on time to board a State Transport bus to Bhor. Bhor is about 65 kms from Swargate, so that effectively translates to about an hour and a half’s travel. The ST bus picks the Kolhapur route to NH17 through the old Katraj tunnel and after a kings ride ;-) we reach Bhor at about 08:30 hrs.\nWith not much scope for a proper breakfast, we hit on a VadaPav stall. A kid about seven years old was running the shop. The way he was handling his customers was an interesting sight. Something I’m sure he would beat most of us at! Had hot tea and Vadapav’s and also got some parceled.\nFor the base point, we had to reach Bajarwadi, a village about 9kms from Bhor. Vaibhav and Siddharth spoke to a few localites and arranged for a Jeep. We reached Bajarwadi at about 08:45 and started the trek at about 09:00hrs. The destination was visible right from the base and it looked pretty easy a trek. The weather got better the higher we climbed. Intermittent showers and heavy winds were consistent company all through the trek. It’s surprising how Nature keeps ridiculing you every time you think you’ve achieved something, always warning you to stay within your limits and not crossing that dividing line!\nBy 10:00hrs we reached the fort entrance. The fort had three consecutive entry doors and right at the entrance was a board put up by the Govt. explaining clearly in Marathi, the history of the fort. Vaibhav translates each word of it and then with that gyan we keep moving across the fort’s various points. Plausibly, the fort was built by Adil shah, then moved over to the hands of Shivaji and finally came uder the control of the ruler of Bhor. I believe, Aurangazeb too was involved in control flow somewhere in between. This is the first time ever that I’ve spent so much time understanding the fort’s history , walking across all the Burj’s and exploring each part of it.\nWe finally decided to stop over at one of the Burj for a quick snack. Just moments after we finished munching, the drizzle started all over again. At about 12:30 hrs we decide to start our descent and get back to Pune. The descent was much easier. At one point, we noticed that with some miniscule element of risk we could find our way to a waterfall. Ashutosh, Akhilesh and I decided to take it up and we did finally reach the cascade. The towering fall was all we needed to remove any body pains! Having had a wonderful massage from the falls, we moved towards the base where Vaibhav, Siddharth and Hitanshu were waiting for us. While we were basking in the waterfall, the other three folks were whiling away time near the Bajarwadi temple watching the village folks playing cricket. Later we got to know that Vaibhav and Siddharth had come almost half way up again searching for us :-) !\nAt about 14:00hrs we got to get into a jeep back to Bhor. At Bhor we had another round of Vadapav ( and not to forget the Spiced up Channa Mix ) and got back to the ST stop to board a bus back to Swargate. Thankfully we didn’t have to wait for long. At about 16:40hrs we reached Swargate and from there boarded a bus to Parihar Chowk. Ashutosh would be in a better position to explain how we boarded the bus ;-) .\nThe week was tiring, the weekend even more! But I believe, that is what keeps you on your toes and when you hit the bed, pains and aches apart; you know you’ve done at least something worthwhile in life!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/06/17/the-rohida-trek/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis week’s been pretty tiring.

Just another drop makes its descent on the already created pool right outside our tent. It\u0026rsquo;s ben raining cats and dogs ever since we reached the base point and there seems to be no sign of it subsiding. Though it\u0026rsquo;s been just about four hours that I\u0026rsquo;ve caught some sleep after having reached the river rafting camp at Kundalika, my brain shows no signs of drowsiness - It\u0026rsquo;s probably the smell of rain that\u0026rsquo;s spruced up my spirits but I believe it\u0026rsquo;s more to do with the sense of a tentative accomplishment of what I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to do for quite some time now.\nAbout eighteen of us had blocked our slots for the June 14th river rafting batch at Kundalika almost two weeks back. Monsoon had just set in here at Pune and this was one of the best times to give this a shot.\n13th June,\nI manage to complete my work by 9:00pm and rush to board the 9:15pm service to Shivaji Nagar. This was were we were supposed to board the bus arranged by the organizers of this event. I reach well before time and am actually surprised to find quite a few people already waiting there for sometime now! Soon Rahul chips in. In the team of 18 or so, he was the only one I\u0026rsquo;d met before. Remaining folks pitch in soon and to add spice to the event, we also have about fifteen foreigners joining us. For apparent reasons ;-) the bus leaves the spot at about 23:15hrs, Four other folks join us enroute and we finally manage to reach Pune outskirts by about 00:15hrs.\n14th June\nThings get peppy in the bus, thanks to an Anthakshari between the other half of the team - a couple of L\u0026amp;T folks and their foreigner counterparts and us. Soon most of us give in ( Or should I say, the other half gave up :-) ! ). Agreed my prowess over Hindi songs is pathetic, but then who cares; I was a part of the winning team! At about 02:00hrs we reach the camp base. One step into the area reminds me of the backwaters in Kerala. The location had been perfectly selected with scores of coconut trees spread out over a vast area of land .\nArun Sir ( The co-facilitator for the event) had already propped up all the tents by the time we reached. So all that we had to do was to divide ourselves into groups of six and hit the beds ( Read plain ground with plastic mounted sheets :-) ). Rahul, Jagdeesh, Sunil, Murali ,KP and I pitch into one of the tents. Rahul had fortunately got his sleeping bag and one of us ( not me obviously !) had brought a thick mattress. All set, we hit the bed in a few moments. I was at the receiving end a few times at night, thanks to Rahul and Murali using their damned wonderful feet! Nevertheless, compromises had to be made when you\u0026rsquo;re camping in a tent and it\u0026rsquo;s raining outside! The team from Mumbai arrive at about 04:30 am.\nAt about 06:00hrs, I\u0026rsquo;m up and to take revenge for the nights trouble, I wake everybody up :-) . They do abuse me mentally for spoiling their sleep and finally we come to terms. We walk over to a mini dike that was regulating water to the river body, pull out some water to wash our faces and start speculating if this was going to be the spot where the river rafting was to start. Soon we get back to the camp and join few folks who\u0026rsquo;d just started playing Volleyball. The rain made things only more interesting and the game went on till about 08:30hrs.\nTea and Poha was provided as breakfast and then started the set of events for the day. Burma bridge to start off was a cake walk. All that was to be done was to climb a tree and walk on a Coconut coired rope tethered at a height of about 10 feet with support provided by two other tethered coirs on either side. Then was the Parallel ropes, wherin one has to walk on a single tethered coired rope with just another coir rope for support at a height of about six feet off the ground. The best event was the Pampered pole wherein one has to climb up an elastic ladder and then bank on to the bark of a tree at a height of about thirty feet. From here all that you had to do was to jump and get hold of a horizontal pole at a distance of about five feet ;-) . Safety wasn\u0026rsquo;t an issue - the person is holstered to propper gear; It\u0026rsquo;s the height that mattered!\nNot many were able to finish these events as we had to start preparing for the rafting. At about 09:30hrs. A brief introduction of the organizing team was done and detailed instructions on what was to be and not to be done while rafting, navigating and possibly drowning ;-) was covered. Each raft would have eight folks each with life jackets, helmets and oars and a navigator. Just before the raft was put in water, the Navigators for each raft held a detailed session on the instructuction code et al.\nRahul, Murali, Monica, KP, Sunil , two other folks and I pitched in into one of the rafts. Robin, a veteran Nepali Raftsman was our Navigator. Moments after the briefing, the actual rafting was started and even before we could realise the rapids started. Robin was pretty stern when it came to navigating. He would literally tap on the person\u0026rsquo;s helmet who was faultering :-) .\nThe whole rafting distance is about 10kms with about 3kms of swimmable expanse. There were about six specific points wherein the rapids were real good. Robin did mention names for the rapids, but then when you\u0026rsquo;re amidst such painfully exemplary surroundings, who would even want to give effort to remembering the names? No words can describe the experience that we had in that two hours stint! The pouring rains, the marauding rapids and the panoramic beauty of nature through the Kundalilka river was simply exhilrating! The swimming phase was just as great! Swimming along the flowing currents is something that I\u0026rsquo;ve never done till this day and today I\u0026rsquo;ve realised how difficult swimming in a river is! Rahul too had his day staying afloat in the life support jacket all the way through. Robin did his best in making the rafting experience worth remembering - Be it in toppling Monica off the Raft in the swimming section :-) or navigating us through the rapids explaining each part of it vividly. One of the rafts toppled over somewhere mid the swimming section and soon the whole expanse had people floating in their life jackets . I seriously have doubts if this was done by the navigator in reason to make the experience more interesting!\nAt about 12:30hrs we managed to reach the end of the white water rafting stretch. Post all the packing of the rafts to the TumTum\u0026rsquo;s and Sumo\u0026rsquo;s we were asked to walk for about a kilometer to get to the spot where a bus would pick us up. The moment we reached there, we found Aditya serving Hot soup and Poha to everyone. Boy, that\u0026rsquo;s the best soup I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had till date! We helped ourselves with one more serving and hunched into the bus.\nA couple of L\u0026amp;T folks ,foreigners, Rahul, Kajal and I got on to the ceiling of the bus. Initially the driver didn\u0026rsquo;t want us to sit atop but then later we( read someone) managed to pursuade him and there we were! It was an absolutely wonderful experience sitting atop the bus on the way back to the base camp. The speed of the bus and the torrential rain brought about the experience of a thousand ants biting us all over! On second thoughts I feel this experience was much better than that during the River rafting :-) .\nWe reached the Base camp at around 14:30hrs. There was a brief rain dance for a few moments and then people who had not completed the Burma bridge, Pampered pole and Parallel ropes got back to it. After a quick lunch and again some Pampered poles , we started packing up and left for Pune at about 17:00hrs.The scenery on the way back was just fabulous! The streaks of cascading white water falls on the towering mountains, the clouds apparently cuting across them, the splintering rain and the chilly climate made a stuendous panoramic view! Nothing to beat Mother Nature\u0026rsquo;s recipes.\nWe reached Pune at around 19:00hrs with stinking pants and bags. At least that was the case with me :-) . One of THE best weekends ever spent in Pune till date in my brief six month stint here. But wait, this weekend\u0026rsquo;s not yet done! There\u0026rsquo;s a trek to Rohida planned tomorrow. All depends on how fit I\u0026rsquo;m at 04:45 am :-) .\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/06/14/kundalika-white-water-rafting/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s about six in the morning.

The Hydventura team had not been for any treks for more than a fortnight now! The anxiety was quite understandable! But then a trip to Mahabaleshwar during this hot summer would do no good. Instead I suggested they come down for the Katraj - Sinhagad trek that I was planning to do the coming weekend.\nA flutter of mails and calls, a week of pooling in and pooling out and all was set! The HydVentura team was all set at a head count of 18 despite a \u0026lsquo;Statutory warning\u0026rsquo; e-mail from Adi ( You\u0026rsquo;ll know who Adi is, had you read my post on my first trek to Sinhagad ). Two days before The Hydventura team arrived I enquired with Abhishek, Abhijeet and Ravi ( The Deccan highlanders Anchors ) if anyone from DH would be interested in joining us. Friday evening, Abhijeet says he had a volatile head count of 20 from the DH team. Boy , this is gonna be real fun!\n17th Morning - Saturday.\nI barely manage to open my eyes and have a look at my watch. Damn! It was 07:45 hrs already. Two days back, i arranged for a Tempo Traveller for the Hydventura team. The driver was to pick me up from my house at Aundh at 8:00 hrs. Right at 08:05 hrs I get a missed call from the Driver. I get ready in a haste, pack my bag and make sure I have at least 2L of water in my bag. Well, you learn from mistakes\u0026hellip;Just one month back on the slopes of the sahayadris we were stalking like dogs for water. Every drop of water was like elixir then!\nWe make it to the station by 08:45 hrs and I while away my time till the Mumbai Express crawls into the station. The team had finally landed in Pune! Gourav, Reshma, Aishwarya, Kirthi, Jemshed, Animesh, Yeshwanth and Venki had been for a few treks along with me. The new faces were Siddharth, Ranjan and Trishna. We moved over to Infy Phase I where they refreshed and had a decent breakfast. Munni and Deepika joined us there. Prasanna was to join us directly at the trek base point - Old Katraj tunnel. It was already 12:30 hrs by the time everyone was ready.\nAt 13:00hrs We moved over towards Bunshi Dam. Not that we expected to see much water, It was only accommodated to keep us busy. We reached the Dam at around 14:20 hrs and idled some time there. Sat by the lake and under the trees not because it was really inviting but just because we had nothing else to do. The water was murky by the banks and the only thing appeasing was that the water was cold. At 15:30 hrs we started moving towards the vehicle when we spotted a guy selling lemon juice and \u0026lsquo;Kala kutta\u0026rsquo;. ( \u0026lsquo;Colored Katta\u0026rsquo; is basically Frothed, Shaped and packed ice dipped in colored syrup / sherbath) .Knowingly or unknowingly we spent almost three fourth of an hour here and spent about 250 Rs. Just for the \u0026lsquo;Mineral water\u0026rsquo; Ice\u0026rsquo;d cream and the lemon juice ! It was worth every rupee! Reshma and Ranjan had their slurps from literally every \u0026lsquo;Colored katta\u0026rsquo; that came from the vendors hands! I bet, He must have closed the shop and gone home after all the profit that we gave him!\nIt was high time, we moved over to Katraj. Besides we hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet had Lunch! At about 17:00 hrs we had our lunch at a roadside dhabha and moved towards Old Katraj. A small accident on the Satara highway caused us to be delayed by a few more minutes. It was almost 18:30 hours by the time we reached the Katraj Muncipal Bus stand. Prasanna, Vishnu, Hari and Pavan joined us there. Gourav and I went on a shopping spree for Chocolates and Biscuits while Animesh and Venki ran about for water bottles. It was a literal shop loot in both the shops. All in all we bought about sixty Five-stars , sixty dairy milks, forty Goodday biscuits and about Sixty five Mineral water bottles. All set , we reached the base trek point at around 19:30 hrs. The DH team had just arrived there a few minutes earlier. Abhijeet was still put up at the city outskirts as he couldn\u0026rsquo;t find proper transport. He turned up too a few minutes later on a tractor!\nAfter a quick distribution of chocolates and Water, the 36 strong team splited into six teams. Suhas and I were the only two people in the team who had been to this trek recently. So the onus of guiding the whole team on the right path was on us. Moving a bit ahead we realized this modus operandi would simply not work. So once we reached a tableland , we regrouped ourselves into four teams. Each team would have a lead and a sweep. Abhijeet opted to be the sweep of the last team so as to keep a tab on the movement. We had quite a few noobies in this trek and no compromise on safety could be made. I was the lead of the first team and Suhas the sweep of the first team. Abhishek, Nitin, Gourav, Animesh and Zohar took up respective responsibilities of lead and sweep for different teams.Though being a huge team, after a reordering of people, we noticed the team picking up speed. The first hill was definitely a solid motivation to the team. ( That was after they got down from it ) . I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t comment on the trek path now because I\u0026rsquo;ve already covered that in my previous post. In fact this was a bit more challenging to me as I had seven 1litre water bottles in my backpack! Reshma couldn\u0026rsquo;t continue with the 2l in her bag post the first hill. So we shifted them into my bag on condition that she\u0026rsquo;d carry the Emptied bottles. Surprisingly, We\u0026rsquo;d covered about seven hills before midnight and the spirits were still high. But for Trishna who had cramps developing on her legs not many had their energies low. But, Later in the morning it so happened that Trishna was in the leading team .\n18th May - Sunday\nI thankfully had not much problem recollecting the trek route from my past experience. Being in the first team is always advantageous. You have the discretionary power to set the team\u0026rsquo;s speed and at the same time you get to rest more frequently than the other teams.\nI missed the track twice during the trek. First time fortunately a Hanuman temple indicated we were in the wrong path. I rightly remember not coming across any temple during my previous trek. Deepika, Meenu and Ranjan helped me track back to the right path. All in all we could have saved about an hours time had I led them in the right direction. Nevertheless, this only added some more thrill to the trek! The second time i missed the track was at the fag end. But then a few other folks were pretty quick in tracing back to the right path.\nWe reached the last hill at about 06:30 hours. All we did once we reached the final hillock was to rest on the Gravel. One view of the sunrise on this peak is enough to rejuvenate you. The soaring sound of the chilled wind, Dew settling on those lucky few shrubs and the rays of the sun slicing through the clouds - Can anything match that feeling?\nWe stayed on the peak for a few more minutes and started moving down the last hill to reach the Sinhagad fort base by 19:30 hrs. Not many of the team members were interested in climbing up the fort. So based on group decision the plan was dropped. Balaji, The TT driver picked us up at around 09:00 hrs and we managed to reach Infy at around 11:00hrs. I got dropped back at Aundh and the Hydventura team left for Hyderabad at around 14:00hrs after refreshing in the Infy Campus.\nAll in all , it was one wholesome experience to trek with such a big enthusiastic group. This time surprisingly we didn\u0026rsquo;t use much water. In fact my bag still had three full water bottles!\nStats/ Details :\nTeam: 36 ( 18 - Hyd , 18- Pune )\nDistance: Approx 10Kms\nStart Point: Old Katraj Tunnel\nDirerctions to reach Basepoint: Pick a Rick/Bus from Swargate and reach Katraj Muncipal Bus stand.

At least, That\u0026rsquo;s the impression I\u0026rsquo;d got when I first heard about it from a few people who\u0026rsquo;d been there already. I always do some ground work before going for a trek to any place. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care to do it this time for no apparent reason! How I wish I did!\nApril 19th:\nAdi was really particular that we have a fast lunch here at Mac\u0026rsquo;D. Ayush joins us after his regular TIME class. The temperature\u0026rsquo;s soaring and the brief respite that we have here is real enthu booster. After a light snack Ayush and I decide to move over to Orange province at Jagtha Diary where the rest of the gang stays. Adi decides to get back home and catch a good sleep. He had to! Tonight would be his first ever trek.\nThe moment we reach the place, I slowly bring in the trek idea for which I\u0026rsquo;d sent in a mail a few days earlier. Finally after an hours coaxing all but Sarfu take the bait . The \u0026lsquo;Girl factor\u0026rsquo; did the trick ! Anmol decides to join us after his classes at 20:30 hrs. Moments before we leave for Aundh to reach the common meeting point , a small issue rises in Orange Province and most of them were compelled to stay back. Animesh, Tiwari and Kamran drop their plans. Anmol quite oblivious of what\u0026rsquo;s cooking back there is fortunately still hooked with the trek. Finally it\u0026rsquo;s just the four of us - Adi, Ayush, Anmol and I.\nAyush and I reach Breman circle at about 20:10hrs and get some Burgers and light snacks parcelled. Adi and Anmol soon catch up with us at about 20:45hrs. We had to reach the Gharware College at Deccan. This was about 6kms from Aundh and with the traffic we manage to reach at about 21:20 hrs . A whole twenty minutes late! Varun, one of the organizers directs us to the place where the rest of the team were waiting for us. Boy, you should have seen the expression of our faces when we realised we were to travel in an open truck to reach the Base start point -Old Katraj tunnel. Not that we\u0026rsquo;ve not traveled in trucks before during our engineering, but we were frankly expecting a decent Bus! Anyway , all of us - about 30 folks jump into the truck and manage to reach the base by around 22:30 hrs. The group majorly comprised of Engg. students , about seven kids, A couple and about Five girls.\nJust as in any trek, At the base we were divided into a couple of groups and each group was given a trek lead. The directions were pretty simple. Take a left a bit ahead , walk along the path then walk around the Transmission tower ( Or whatever that was ) and then just keep walking further till you find a Tower with the red light blinking. Well that\u0026rsquo;s the tower at Singhad. For about half a kilometer we didn\u0026rsquo;t find sight of the red light and finally when we did, we realised what was ahead - About eight huge hills to traverse !!\nThe first hill was the best! The climate was pretty cool and the chilled wind blowing through the face was pretty much invigorating. But then trekking is not just about enjoying nature as if you have all the time in the world. It\u0026rsquo;s more about reaching the destination in the pre-set time.\nApril - 20th\nWe kept moving ahead and soon it was time to get down the hill! Phew that was steep! real steep! We moved hesitatingly downwards and this by itself took us about half an hour. At the base, we had Suhas to remind us that we had only seven more hills to cover! We moved, ran , rested, hiked, howled, teased around and finally reached the place where we decided to break. A soup was on the way . Taste mattered the least here! Half an hour of break after covering about three hills and most of the folks were already down. I\u0026rsquo;m sure Adi was pledging to screw me royally once we were back home! All i could read from his mind was that Hell seemed quite close atop that Hill!\nWe leave from that place at about 04:30 hrs and someone again reminded just five more hills to traverse to reach the destination! The hill after that was done quickly and then started the real fun. Energy levels were real down and we didn\u0026rsquo;t even have water! Down slopes were steep and the pebbles there made things more difficult. Adi couldn\u0026rsquo;t get down the slope anymore. His phobia of heights loomed in again! He literally started scraping his ass on the slopes. His weight made things worse. The pace was miserably slow. We were the last few in the group. We were mid way and there was no turning back.There was no one to blame but me! I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have got them to the trek in the first place. In fact at times i was wondering if they\u0026rsquo;ll even make it to the destination in one piece! Boy, Adi was miserably down.\nWe saw the sunrise in one of the intermediate hills and kept inching towards the final hill. Adi soon had company. Hemant just couldn\u0026rsquo;t move his legs. All our massages and motivations were just not working ! At about 08:00 hrs we had a glimpse of the road. As Anmol rightly put it - the road to Salvation! Just two more hills to go and that meant two more miserably painful downhill traversal for Adi. The Sun was adding fuel to fire! Hemant fell flat at the last hill. He had no energy to move further. Varun and Ankul managed to arrange some water . Sanjay gave him a proper massage and suggested we keep moving. They stayed back for a few more minutes. The moment we reached atop the last hill, I was more than elated! They\u0026rsquo;d made it! All were in one piece but for bruises here and there.\nThe moment we reached the destination there were a couple of folks supplying water . Man! Water never tasted that sweet till date! We had some Poha and jumped into the truck. The way back was another pain. Hot sun looming over our heads and we had literally no energy even to talk. Reached Aundh at around 11:30 hrs. Gulped four glasses of lemon juice, about two liters of water, four oranges and two apples! Had a well deserved bath and hit the bed only to get up after a solid seven hour sleep!\nWhat was supposed to be a Moonlight trek turned out to be a nightmare with the Sun high above us. The Katraj - Sinhgad trek is something that I\u0026rsquo;d never forget and I\u0026rsquo;m sure neither Anmol nor Adi would even venture for another trek with me!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/04/20/the-moonlight-trek-that-was-not/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e04:30 Hrs in the morning and we\u0026rsquo;ve still got about four more hills to cross to complete the trek.

Well, I’ve not really been to Colorado as such but then some things just get etched in your mind the moment you have a look at it and subtle things such as this remind you of the greater vacuum you need to fill! Probably it’s not too long before I trek the Grand Canyon! :-)\nLast weekend was one hell of a weekend! In fact this was my first ever outing after having reached Pune. I initially planned to go for river rafting at a place close by but then backed off because of the cost involved and besides, I had no company! Just before my glorious weekend plan loomed to doom :-) Ayush pitched in saying he was game for any outing! All it requires is two to start something! Both of us decided to explore some good place in Pune irrespective of anyone else joining us. We in fact wanted to do a totally unplanned trip. But it so happened that soon Nimish , Aditya and Namrata chipped in and we were compelled to have an arranged ‘tourist types’ trip! Something that we wanted to avoid for no practical reason :-) . But later we realized, this was one good decision we made! :-)\n6th April - Sunday\nAyush and I spoke to a travels guy close to Aundh and finalized on a Travera. We could accommodate three more people in it but then no one else was even ready to join us. Lazy bums! :) We finalized the trip for 3 grand given that he shows us places in and around Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar. We asked him to pick us up at 5:30 in the morning the next day.\n7th April - Monday\nWonder why it happens all the time! This jerk with a tuft turns up at 6:45 and gives the same excuse – flat tire! I was reminded of the Sangamam trip in Bangalore when the driver turned up three hours late! ? Anyway Adi, Ayush and I got into the cab at Aundh and directed him to Jabtha bheri where we had to pick Namrata. Nimish was staying at his sisters place( believe somewhere close to Shivapura ) so he punched in a while later. It was about 9:00am by the time we reached a roadside restaurant –Joshi Wadewala. Had a sumptuous breakfast here ( Wada pav and Missal Pav is what they call standard BF items here :-) ! ). This is just a few minutes after crossing the New Katraj tunnel and is a well known stop point for frequent wayfarers on the Pune – Satara route (NH4).\nWe take a right somewhere after we cross Shirwal and from there starts the winding routes to Panchgani . Moments before we reach Parsi Point, we notice a group of trekkers scaling up the hill to our right! They must have had a ball of a time scaling up the peak all night! We reach Panchgani by around 9:45 am. Parsi Point is the first alight point for visitors to Panchgani. It’s nothing more than a small park with kids play equipment. The view point from here overlooks the Krishna valley and waters of the Dhom Dam. We idled some time on the ‘Only 13yrs and above’ slides :-) and soon left for Mahabaleshwar.\nOur guide cum Driver suggested we first finish spots in Mahabaleshwar and then get back to Panchgani on our way back. Mahabaleshwar is about 15kms from Panchgani and is known for the various Viewpoints which give a birds eye view of the valleys, besides the Panchganga Mandir . We cross the Mapro gardens in Panchgani and reach the first set of viewpoints. There are about seven to eight points that are described at the entrance. As you walk through the hill down the path a couple of points turn out at the corners. You end up watching quite a few scenic spots but the crowd at the place happens to nullify the actual effect. Nature is best enjoyed when alone! More so on high peaks such as this!\nThe Kates point again gives you a spectacular view of the Krishna Valley from a different angle. The Elphinston point a few paces ahead gives a spectacular view of the Koyna and Sahyadri valleys! Down south to this point is the the Hunter’s point which gives a splendid view of the Koyna Valley. Move down a bit more and you come across something called the Arthur’s seat. This is the place that clearly demarcates the Konkan and Deccan territories in Mahabaleshwar by the barren deep Savitri valley to the left and a shallow valley to the right. To the left on Arthurs seat you have a series of steps that lead you to Tiger springs. This is where the River Savitri is supposed to emerge. We spend some time around these points and then move over to Monkey point and Savitri point. Savitri point is one beautiful place to be! Infact I found this to be quite appealing – very little open space, not much crowd and then the DEEP valleys were just inches from where we stood! A few minutes later we realized this to be a wonderful echo point! You get a resound of your voice after about five seconds! :-)\nWe leave for the Mahabaleshwar town and then visit the Panchganga mandir. This place has it in the hindu mythology that the five rivers Krishna, Venna, Gayatri, Savitri and Koyna show their appearance in the form of five close springs and make their presence here. Water from this place falls into a decently big cistern sorta built enclosure and is considered to be pretty holy! All that mattered to me though was that the water was pretty tasty and really cold :-) . Besides we also had a couple of women get into the water and start wailing the moment their feet touched the water. Superstitions abundant! Would still love to know the funda behind their impromptu wailing :-) :-) !\nWe then had a sumptuous lunch at a restaurant in the town and then got back to the cab . The driver then drove us to the Venna lake where boating is pretty famous. We opted for the Rowing boat. None of us knew rowing so we took a guide along with us! Was mighty fun rowing the boat for about half an hour. Just beside the Venna lake is a vast barren land where Horse riding is allowed. This Is something that you simply should not miss! Ayush and I had infact started racing after five rounds! It was like we were perfect Jockeys. The horses here were well maintained and mighty well trained. All we had to do was to keep our ass on the Horse while it madly ran across the land and keep thumping it to keep the momentum :-) .\nIt was 5:30 pm already. So we decided to start moving towards Panchgani. As we were falling short of time we had to forego visiting Table land, lingamalla falls and Tapola lake ( The mini Kashmir in the west) . On our way back we dropped by Mapro gardens. Mahabaleshwar is famous for Strawberries! And this is one place where you get damn cheap strawberry Jams, squashes and fruits as such. They also had a Bungy jumping types event organized wherein you are tethered in between two poles with elastic ropes and a person controls your elevation and descent. The base is a very elastic mat and is about 60m dia. With Pneumatic control you are jettisoned up into air and the elasticity of the ropes controls your ascent and descent! Jumping up and down in the air to a height of about 60 feet by pneumatic and elastic control is one hell of an experience! :-) :-)\nWe finally moved over to the last destination where Parasailing and Paragliding is supposed to take place. Unfortunately a mishap had occurred just before we arrived there and the event had to be closed. The open land, the meek drizzle of the rain and the deep valley a few steps away made the ambience even more spectacular! Spent about half an hour there and finally left back to Pune. We reached the city outskirts by around 8:15pm where Ayush and Nimish got down. Adi and I got back to Aundh at around 8:45 pm after dropping Namrata at her house.\nAll in all it was one memorable trip!! The place gets even more inviting during early monsoon. Probably we’ll be revisiting it sometime again and this time we know what to plan for! :-)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/04/11/the-indian-grand-canyon/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m woken up by a jerk as the Travera winds its way up the circuitous roads.

That day during lunch we laid down action points and as days passed, things slowly got hard lined and a trip to Kolar was planned for the second weekend of March. The initial count was just 9 and right when we were thinking of canceling the outing, people slowly started piping in. Surprisingly, the response soared so fast that we had to freeze registrations for the trip by 10th evening. The final count was twenty one - seven girls and fourteen guys!\nOn 14th evening, all of us met at the Gachibowli Y Junction and boarded the semi sleeper to Bangalore. Out of the 21, five of us ( Nayan, Reshma, Aishwarya, Gaurav and I) had been together for Hydventura’s first outing to N’sagar and Ethipothala. To break the ice we had a brief introduction of each of us and to make things interesting Srikanth AKA Jiddu suggested we add a tagline to our description. Fortunately the crowd was a bindaas cult! To while away time we had various activities like Dumb C and Anthakshari. At around 9:00pm we stopped at a dhabha for dinner. Most of us hit our seats by 10:00pm but nothing to beat the spirits of Jiddu, Vikranth , Aishwarya and Animesh! They kept singing till 11:30 at night sitting on the bus floor at the rear end.\nParasailing , Rock Climbing and Cave Explorations – Hoskote, AntharGange(Kolar)\n15th Morning at around 5:30 pm I lose my sleep. I wake Gourav Baduri and Shiv up. We then decide to wake up the remaining eighteen folks. Baduri does what he’s best at, Hops around in a jiffy and even before the bus traverses another 100 yards everyone’s up! Did I mention, the three of us occupied the first row of seats and hence had a wonderful sleep all through the journey ;-) ! Literally swearing on us they soon get back to their spoiled slumber and even before they’re able to catch a good nap, by 7:30 we reach AnandRao Circle. This is where we were supposed to meet Sashi, from Adventura . We freshen up at the Yatri nivas in the Majestic bus station and leave for Hoskote in a Mazda . By around 11:00 am we reach Hoskote where we meet the rest of the Adventura team! Suma and Vishal da along with the Adventura team give us all a huge hearty welcome and with a brief introduction we have a wonderful breakfast of idli, upma and sweets and bananas !\nThe team from Adventura had reached Hoskote way before us, so they’d started the parasailing activity. It was almost 12:30 by the time they completed their flights. Meanwhile, Suma, Vishal, Sashi, Kedar and a few other folks shared with us their experiences from their previous outings. It was about 4:30pm that the hyd team finished their para-sailing. For most of them, this was the very first time they were flying. So they did have a wonderful time! Mudit, Ankur and Manish were really ecstatic after their flight. Last time I\u0026rsquo;d been for para-sailing I regretted not having taken a camera along with me up there in the air. I sorted it out this time :-) !\nThe Adventura folks had already left to Kolar for rock climbing and rappelling. So by the time we reached there, we had ample time to move around and finish our part of the activities. Rappelling was much easier and seemed pretty simple. I’m not sure if it was the height that made us feel that way or that we had higher expectations. For a few, climbing the rock to get to the peak for rappelling down seemed more challenging ;-) . Neha felt otherwise though! She\u0026rsquo;d accepted she had a phobia of heights but proved herself wrong by finally rappelling down with a bit of coaxing! Jiddu on the other hand, took the tether guy for a ride by rappelling with his back on the rocks, rather than his firm feet!\n\u0026lt;\np class=\u0026ldquo;MsoNormal\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;\nWe had a very late lunch after this and then moved over to explore the rocky terrains around the place. Shashi took us out to a couple of interesting rock formations. It was real fun hopping from one place to another maneuvering through the volcanic formations! Snehith, Nayan and Shashi had a tough time trying to get hold of people\u0026rsquo;s feet ;-) and grooving them in the right spot for a safe descent form a steep rock. It was already 7:00pm by then and Suma had made a call for all of us to return to a central meeting point for us to further decide on the course of action. By the time we reached the meeting spot, Ruchi, Meera and couple of others were cutting Watermelons for us. It was a feast for everyone having walked and climbed a bit on slippery terrains.\nFinally when most of us made it to the spot Suma and Vishal da suggested we explore the caves around the place and then get back to the same spot by 9:00 pm the latest. Having got a consent from each and every team member, we were divided into four teams - Each having one leader, one sweep and six other members. The leader had to keep a watchful eye on the surroundings and guide his team, the sweeper had to see to it that his team members were together and that the team following him wasn\u0026rsquo;t too far from his team. Every ten minutes the leader of each team had to whistle once and shout out the team name in succession. A dual whistle would mean that the team wants some rest and a successive three pronged whistle would mean danger lurking and a state of high alert. White Snakes, Black Hawks, Sholay and Ghost Riders were the names each team decided to have. Besides this we had Suma, Vishal, Sashi and a couple of other Adventura members patrolling across each of the teams to ensure that everything was fine. All through the trek, our main guides where Munni Raj and Girish - two village kids :-) ! I being the lead of White snakes - the first team, by default became the victim of their non stop chatter. Munni Raj would never move forward without the consent of his teacher ( read Suma ) and always kept his 10th class friend ( read me ) at a ears distance with his chitter chatter :-) .\nWe walked through a couple of barren lands whistling and shouting back instructions, before we reached the rocks where we could start our cave explorations. To start off, the rocks looked pretty simple to squeeze across. But with passing time, we soon understood we\u0026rsquo;re being taken for a ride by nature! Wriggling and Squeezing soon became the order of the night! At a certain spot the crevices between the rocks became so narrow that, it became quite difficult for a few people to get across. Aishwarya got stuck in between and it took almost an hour of coerced efforts by Jiddu and a couple of others to get her out . Looking back, this made things only more interesting :-) !\nIt was already 10:00 by then and we had not yet covered one fourth of the planned exploration. Shashi, Vishal and Suma took stock of the situation and soon decided to cut short the whole exploration with the group\u0026rsquo;s consent. Shashi and I moved a bit forward to judge the path and were thankful enough to find a path very soon. We waited for a few more minutes for the remaining teams to arrive at a common spot and then started moving towards the base spot finding our way. The way back was just a routine walk back but the whole episode of wriggling, long jumping, and navigating through the rocks with Bottles and torches in our hand, in a deserted land is just something unforgettable!\nBack at the Anthargange base, we had two options - To camp there and move towards Kalvarhalli betta the next day morning or move right away to Kalvarhallibetta base and start trekking up the hill so as to watch sunrise early in the morning at the peak. The whole group was ready for the latter option. Suma had warned us that it had rained heavily the previous day and the rocks would be slippery,. nevertheless it was safe to trek upwards and we could always decide to camp at the base till the next day morning if at all the rocks were that slippery. In another ten minutes we jumped into the Qualis and Mazda and drove to the Kalvarhalli betta base. We reached the base at about 00:30 in the morning.\nThe Kalvarhallibettta trek\nOnce we reached the base, we had no reasons to deny our bellys the long needed nourishment. Vishal had brought a stove and quite a few Heat 2 eat dishes. Had a sumptuous dinner and then decide to start trekking to the peak. Meera, Kedar and Martina decided to stay back and get a good sleep. The rest of us regrouped into teams and started the trek guided by Vishal , Suma ,Supradeep and Shashi. Trekking was something that I perceived as a walk across a barren terrain with lots of trees and shrubs. Till yesterday, I never related it to climbing rocks and marshy lands atop a hill :-) . As the altitude increased , the trailing teams soon lost track of the frontal teams. Being the first team again, we had the privilege to halt and wait for other teams to pitch in.\nTrekking at nights on a hilly terrain comes with it\u0026rsquo;s own advantages. One being that altitude is never a hindrance. All you need to do is watch your step and stay concentrated. The darkness of the night keeps fear of height at bay! The Kalvarhalli betta trek has taught me to love myself better! At one point of time, Shashi, Irfan, Ruchi and a few others moved from the teams behind and formed a new team - Team 0. We, the white snakes were to trail them. But it so happened at one point of time near the peak that I lost track of their path. Idiotically Sensing the path myself I led a couple of others on a path which I realised later, that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have. I\u0026rsquo;d diverted to a very small extent away from the path. But then that could have costed us our lives. Prasanna ideally decided to stay put at his position. The rock was pretty slippery and with moss all around, getting a hold was very difficult. Even before I realised my mistake I lose hold on my grip and start skidding down the mossy rock. Fortunately I could get hold of some sturdy grass and gained back control. All I did then was to stay put at that spot till someone came across me along the right path. A few minutes later Suma fortunately came across and led us in the right path. I realised the seriousness of the situation only during the trek downhill. Had I not caught hold of the shrubs at the right moment, things would have been totally different today!\nThe trek uphill took us almost two hours to complete. We reached the peak at about 5:15am. Most of us tried catching some sleep but the frost and the chilled atmosphere made things only worse. All we did was to listen to the soothening guitar strokes by someone who\u0026rsquo;d come up there well before us. People from other groups soon joined us at the peak.\nBy around 6:15am at the break of dawn all our eyes popped to the east, eagerly waiting for the Sun to rise. But as luck would have it it turned out to be a cloudy morning and getting a glimpse of Sunrise at that height on cloudy morning was something that nature would just not sell! Nevertheless, the frost, mist and the very altitude of the peak made the view breathtaking. Water dripping on your body, head and chilling wind sizzling across you at that altitude is probably one of those several ways by which you are reminded of your helplessness and stature, however high your position in social life be! Till today I was under the impression Pictures speak better than words, Pictures bring out the thick and thin of an event. But today I\u0026rsquo;ve realised there\u0026rsquo;s something else that pictures just cannot replicate, something that they would fail to evoke that the human eye captures in a jiffy.\nAt 7:30am we started our trek downhill. Downhill trekking was much more difficult than uphil! Thanks to the daylight , consistently reminding you that one wrong step would mean you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be where you are now. Aching knees made things worse! Not even quarter way through downhill, I hear a sound of a female singing in pristine glory - rumbling rock on the way, give way. No second guesses of who she is - Suma! Later when I meet her about half an hour later at the base she tells me she\u0026rsquo;s created a record for herself- down the hill running in fifteen minutes!\nSuma, Snehith, Ram , Ruchi, Sashi , Irfan and I reach the base well before others. Down at the base when I look at the height we\u0026rsquo;d covered, it makes me wonder how we tend to limit our own capabilities by the sheer first hand vision of a problem. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure, had we seen the height of the peak at night we would have taken longer than the two hours!\nWe reach the base location by 8:00am and fresh up at the close by ashram. It\u0026rsquo;s almost 9:30 by the time everyone gets down and gets fresh. We then have a sumptuous breakfast which Vishal, Ruchi, Jiddu and a couple of others have prepared and plan to leave for Bangalore. The Nandi hills plan is dropped as not many people are interested in visiting it. We Hydventura folks bid adieu to the Adventura team at around 10:15 am and leave for Bangalore city. Snehith , Surabhi , Shuvam and a couple of others leave by a qualis. The rest of us leave with us in a mazda. Kedar joins us in the mazda and is back to form in a few minutes snapping shots of people sleeping :-) . Due to time constraints, Animesh suggests we change the plan and decide to take the Hebbal route to bangalore. Vinayak and Rashmi get down at Mekhri Circle. Aishwarya and Neha leave for their relatives place at Malleshwaram. The rest of us hop into a Pizza hut and have a long deserved pizza! We reach the Yeswantpur station by around 3:00 pm and there begins our 1 hour wait for the train back to Hyd. Aishwarya, Neha, Nayan, Surabhi soon join us at around 3:30pm. Reshma, Jiddu and I manage to get some tight sleep moments after we board the train. At around 7:00pm Devyani, Surabhi and Pooja join us for dinner. We chat for sometime and as they continue playing Cards I hit the berth by 9:30pm.\n17th March\nMorning at around 4:45 am the train chugs into the Kacheguda station. This is when Devyani realises she\u0026rsquo;s lost her w710i and we get to know that Prasanna had lost his digicam the previous night. Real sad the two day eventful journey had to end at this note!\n8:15 am and a couple of us are back to office!Rest follow soon\u0026hellip;\nAll in all, it was a stupendous , unforgettable trek that I\u0026rsquo;ve done so far!

I had to buy a couple of DVDs and a few books for my nephew \u0026rsquo;s and nieces. I got into Big Bazaar and walked directly to the Kids section.

I initially thought this would just be a pick and run shopping, but it turned out to be a total turn plate! :-)\nI flipped through a few CD\u0026rsquo;s and DVDs, found only a few interesting and put them aside. A few minutes later, I picked a couple of night time story books and thought I\u0026rsquo;m all done. The queue was quite big at the billing counter and I was the last person standing there. Just around this moment, an old lady and her grand daughter walked in to the store and started sifting through the collection. The Lady picked up a couple of DVDs and asked the kid if she liked the selection. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to be there to see the response the kid gave :-) ! She was like - I \u0026rsquo;ve gone through this shit several times, get me something new :-) ! That made me have a re-look on my selection and that is when I realised what dumb collection I had selected :-) ! A bit more backtracking made me realise I had already bought similar stuff last year!\nThe next moment I fell out of the queue and started sifting through the collection again.Still, I was no where close to getting a decent collection for the kids. Before I finally gave up I thought the best thing to do would be to talk to my sis and SIL to know exactly what they were looking for.Placed a brief call to both of them and got inputs from them. Then on, the selection was a mere cakewalk. Fortunately when I was done there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anyone standing in the queue.

As I\u0026rsquo;m already awake by then, I recognize the person at the other end to be Gaurav Saxena. Just a wake up call he says! Gaurav\u0026rsquo;s been one of the most active members of Hydventura and today morning he\u0026rsquo;s taken the responsibility of spoiling everyone\u0026rsquo;s sleep just to see to it that things go as planned :-) ! A few minutes later I get a call from him informing that he just had a bad fall and would not be able to join us for the trip. A pity that that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t join us!\nThe earlier day we\u0026rsquo;d planned to start off from Infy campus by around 5:45 am. Nayan and Gaurav had arranged the Swaraj Mazda and Venkatesh happily donned the responsibility of being the treasurer for the trip. The group had decided on the route that the vehicle would take to pick up people as close as possible to their residence. As planned, everyone was ready at their respective pick up point more or less on time. We reached the city limits at about 7:15 am and from there started the three and a half hour journey to Nagarjunsagar.\nWe\u0026rsquo;d arranged for a quick breakfast right in the bus to avoid getting delayed any further. Gaurav and Co. had made arrangements for Bread-Butter-Jam, Frootie packs and Water. I\u0026rsquo;d got Chips packed from Hot Chips. We also had Haldiram\u0026rsquo;s namkeen and biscuits doing rounds :-) . Having spiked our energy levels we decided to have a brief introduction. We were 15 of us ( Gaurav having dropped ) , and not many of us knew each other prior to this. It was quite surprising to know we had an amateur photographer (Gourav Bhaduri ), Ace advenurers ( Abhishek Tiwari , Aishwarya) et al in our group.The only outfoscion :-) in our first Hydventura trip was Chaithanya - Sushyamala\u0026rsquo;s bro. As with any group outing we decided to play Dumb charades. Sandeep Sarda made the whole activity lot more peppy with his gyan and out of the blue ;-) thinking . By the time we\u0026rsquo;d reached Sagar, it was almost 10:45 am.\nWe\u0026rsquo;d decided to finish the NagarjunaKonda visit before lunch. The next launch ferry was at around 11:15. The launch was a Diesel boat capable of holding about 300 people. The close to 45 minutes ride and the beating sun did go a long way in helping the vendors sell cool drinks and other snacks. The ride was more or less monotonous and at times it was frustrating to move at that slow a speed. Yashawant and Nayan had a different experience though.They had kids who\u0026rsquo;d come for an excursion teaching them telugu! Reshma was no less in getting gyan from kids on the other side :-) . Things travel teach you :-) !\nWe reached the island by around 12:30pm thanks to the delayed start of the launch. Being given 1hr to get back to the launch, we started walking towards the Museum. The stupas and the Altars were pretty impressive. I\u0026rsquo;d been to the Museum a few years back so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really that enthralling to me. But it is a must watch , for first timers. It gives you a brief glimpse on life in the early ages.\nDone with this we moved over to the strategically placed canteen. From here you get to see the vastly spaced out reservoir totally devoid of any urban representations. The blue waters, seemingly flowing onwards to meet the blue hued sky and the rocky lands at a distance is a sight you need to see with your own eyes to admire. Truly breath taking! With a brief photo session here by our ace photographer, we hunched back to the launch point.Again a 45 minute ride on the reservoir waters and we\u0026rsquo;re back to the main banks. About 2:30 pm now, All we needed was some food ( For thought ;-) ? ) ! We walked towards the closest hotel and ordered Thalis for everyone. I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure what to give credit to - the relishing meal or the gnarling rats in our stomachs. But whatever be the case, we did have one good sumptuous meal :-) !\nIt was about 4:00 pm now and we decided to move over to Ethipothalla falls. The 12kms drive took us about twenty minutes to get there. I was initially very keen on visiting this place but only the moment I was there did it loom on me that I\u0026rsquo;d actually been to this place before. The water then in the falls was pretty murky and the whole experience was pretty bad. But believe me, this time it was far far better. The flow was pretty good and the waters much cleaner. Varun , Sandeep, Abhishek Ramakant and Abhishek tiwari had brought their shorts and hence moved over closer to the falls. The stones were pretty slippery but why fear when we had an 80 year young lady to help us cross it :-) ? Most of us finally made it close to the falls when Suyshamala slipped over the algae and got her dead cells on one of her toes chipped out. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big hurt but then she couldn\u0026rsquo;t continue standing in the waters, so she had to get back to the other side. Just a few moments after we finish cleansing her wound, Aishwarya took the next seat :-) . Thanks to the old woman who stepped on her feet while she was getting back to the safer side :-) . Venki got so tempted by the crabs there that he asked the woman if she could catch some for him. How good would it have been had the woman accepted!\nThis falls is truly a must see if you\u0026rsquo;ve come to Nagarjunsagar. But wait! There\u0026rsquo;s more to Ethipothalla than just the falls. There\u0026rsquo;s a very small temple right beside the kutcha path to the falls. Next time you\u0026rsquo;re there be sure to catch a glimpse of goat and bird legs hanging by the tree branch at about your shoulder\u0026rsquo;s height :- ) . Divine Sacrifice huh! All of us finally got back to the vehicle with two hopping females giving company to the ever present monkeys there :-) .\nWe now had to find a small clinic to nurse Suysh\u0026rsquo;s wound. About seven kilometers from there we did find one and got the wound dressed. All of us had tea at a small tea stall and then moved over to the Broken bridge of Nagarjunsagar. But the moment we were there , we realised they\u0026rsquo;d blocked entrance to the bridge and we couldn\u0026rsquo;t move any further. Fortunately we found something else much more interesting. There was a temple right beside it and the path down the temple was really inviting! It was a rocky terrain and finally when we managed to reach the bank, it just loomed on us what good a decision we\u0026rsquo;d taken to come down there! Venki, Sandeep, Varun, Gourav Nayan and Yashwant tried their hands on Stone throwing while Vairav, Chaithu, Aishwarya , Reshma and I ventured into the slippery knee deep water flow.Slippery it pretty much was but not really dangerous. Chaithanya and I ventured almost half past the river flow. The sheer force with which the waters gush across you sort of revitalizes your fatigued body. Vishesh soon joined us along with the other folks. Spent quite some time here and finally left for the city at about 6:45pm.\nThe way back was pretty funny and interesting. We decided to play Truth or Dare to while away time. The peppy questions being put forth and the more so the answers made things all the more interesting. Chaitu with his cat walk, Gourav becoming a goat, Yahswant farting like an elephant and I enacting a cabiree were a few of the dare events :-) . Thanks to Nayan, Vairav and Reshma took revenge on each other with their mock proposals :-) All in all it was a wonderful time ! We then stopped over at a roadside restaurant at Ibrahimpatnam and had a decent dinner. It was almost 11:30 by the time we reached the city :-) .\nThe trip was definitely worth the money spent. It was great getting to know people and we did get to have a wonderful weekend!

It did avoid the hassle of downloading the code from the website and burning it on to a ROM and the service by Rainbow Computech was pretty good. I got the DVD delivered to my home in three days with regular updates from them regarding the shipment. Wish the install was as easy as this! :-(\nFirst things first. I\u0026rsquo;m a quasi noobie :-) when it comes to installing Operating systems. So my experience would tell you what not to do when installing an OS :-) .If you are still contemplating on installing solaris with XP as a dual boot, be forewarned, you\u0026rsquo;re entering lukewarm waters. It\u0026rsquo;s real sad that I sound so very negative but I\u0026rsquo;m really frustrated with how things have turned up. Just Imagine! You have that cutie pie OS right in your System but still can\u0026rsquo;t use it. The worst part being that you still don\u0026rsquo;t know what to look for where and Google ain\u0026rsquo;t helping a bit.\nThankfully this time I backed up vital data on my disk before I ventured into the forest. I honked the DVD drive out and forked in the DVD. Rebooted my system and initiated the DVD boot. Quite expectantly, the installers GUI failed and I had to navigate through text mode installation. Thanks to my 17\u0026quot; Extra Wide LCD monitor, I had to keep altering the image display to have a look at the command statements in each and every screen. Finally when I make it to the partitioning screen, the lord starts demanding- Open Solaris 10 needs to be installed on a primary partition alone. I had installed Win Xp in the primary partition and had a couple of other drives similarly configured. Gutsy Gibbon was hatching golden eggs in the extended partition :-) . Looking at the screen, I initially was in the mindset of formatting one of the subsidiary drives and making it the primary one to cater to Solaris\u0026rsquo;s request. But then the installer was not making things any easier. The only option it gave me was to totally erase the drive and create solaris partitions. It just wanted full control on the drive! :-) . Probably there was a customization menu somewhere but as the monitor was as such giving trouble, I gave in too. Having taken full control over the drive the installation crooned it\u0026rsquo;s way to 100 percent completion.\nIt finally spitted out the DVD and reboots. Ah! and what do I find?It asks me for the login. Login? I wonder - what login? I remember it asking for root password but never in the installation did it ask me to give a default login. I understand Linux installations have this default login name. It varies for each OS but I never tried looking for the default login of OpenSol. It just didn\u0026rsquo;t strike me! So there ended the Open Sol saga- part one. leaving me with a lame hard disk with no OS to work on. How far can a noobie go with CUI :-( ? Finally , I gave up and installed the bland Win XP again. Moments later I realize, Microsoft ain\u0026rsquo;t any good. It overwrites the previous MBR with its own setup. Sigh! Wish people came with a sweet heart! Now I have Win xP on a primary partition and the lame OpenSol on another!\nToday, curiosity got the better of me and I restarted the OpenSol installation. Thankfully, the installation recognizes the previous setup and asks me whether I want to upgrade the OS. Jubilantly, I configure it to do the needful and the upgrade starts. It goes on and on and on and finally it gives me a status - Upgrade Complete. Aye Sir, Me is on cloud nine :-) . I let it spit the DVD out and am eager to see the aesthetic OpenSol Splash grub menu. Someone rightly said, never expect the expected. Screw Him! The System reboots and what do I get to see? Welcome to Microsoft Windows!!! I\u0026rsquo;m at loss of words.\nOpen Sol is a wonderful OS and I\u0026rsquo;d love to work on it. Accepted, there\u0026rsquo;s something that I\u0026rsquo;ve missed out during the installation that led it to screw me but on a second thought- Can\u0026rsquo;t the installation be made any simpler? Can\u0026rsquo;t they provide a much better partition management tool? Johnathan! Are you listening? :-)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be back a few days later when I have some time to make my hands greasier . Till then - Amen!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/02/18/opensolaris-installation/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d ordered the Solaris 10 DVD from a third party agent a few days back.

She turns back and keeps looking at my bus wide mouthed.\nAt the next crossroads we happen to come face to face again and this time she takes the initiative of smiling and then waves her hand. I wave back in a kiddo fashion :-) .This makes her more ecstatic. She beckons her friends and says something. All of them then turn towards me, then gape at each other and giggle like nuts.\nBoy! Wish I could capture that Kodak moment.There\u0026rsquo;s a lot that we tend to forget in this mad race called life.

Even worse, when things come to the fag end and wherein competition is amongst the equals. The way a show evolves more or less depends on how the emotions of the participants are handled collectively by the anchor and the judges. I remember watching a show quite sometime back where things turned the other way round. The judge happened to go overboard with his comments and the contestant just couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle it. Supporters of the contestant grew wild and it took the organisers quite some time to get the situation back under control.\nThe same scenario when related to real life, throws light on how critical saying the right words at the right time is. As I see it , Communication is 25 percent of knowledge and 75 percent of skillset! All that matters is how efficiently you can portray your thoughts in a given time span.\nDo have a glimpse of the show when you\u0026rsquo;re free.

It makes me wonder at times why it always happens this way. You never even bother to think about them when you have all the time in the world but when they\u0026rsquo;re right in front of you, you want those moments to just get back to you.\nI\u0026rsquo;d been to Chennai with a few of my friends from Hyderabad for my convocation last weekend. Though we\u0026rsquo;d applied for the In-Absentia mode, we thought this was one event we just couldn\u0026rsquo;t miss. Machi, Adi, Abi and I left on friday evening by the Egmore Exp. MV, Kittu and his cousin Hari joined us at the station. Kranthi and Thopz were supposed to meet us but then had to drop their plans as they\u0026rsquo;d got their visa for their Masters at Hertfordshire university and had to fly the next day. The train journey was as such pretty boring. We reached Arrakonam at about five in the morning. People started pouring in by around 6:30 am. We managed to get a room in one of the lodges and left for the University at around 11:00 am.\nThe convocation was to begin at around 3:00pm and registrations were supposed to be done with by 1:00 pm. As we\u0026rsquo;d applied for the In-Absentia mode, we were relative free. Our time was best spent in the classrooms and the hostel rooms. The moment you\u0026rsquo;re in the hostel, you\u0026rsquo;ve got people all over the place calling you \u0026lsquo;Anna\u0026rsquo; :-) It was in fact wonderful to get back to those \u0026lsquo;Senior\u0026rsquo; days! People keep asking you advices , career prospects or just for the heck of it pull your leg, very well knowing that you\u0026rsquo;re just a year wiser than them. But still even that matters ;-)\nThe main event was as somber as it can get. The regular lecturing stuff, nothing really motivating. The person is called on to the stage , a moment for which he\u0026rsquo;s been paying shit loads of money for the past four years and finally when that moment comes he gets to be there only for a second. I wonder how convocations in Foreign Universities are! Here it\u0026rsquo;s more of a formality than a bonding between the university and the alumni. Moments after the ceremony got over, I had to rush to the Admin to get my certificate . They\u0026rsquo;d told me that the certificate wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be handed to me on the stage as I\u0026rsquo;d not registered prior to the convocation. Anyways, looking at how things went in the ceremony, I\u0026rsquo;m more than happy I got to be away from it and enjoy the fun from far ;-) . It at least gave me some time to catch up with people whom I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether or not I would meet later.\nWe decided to stay back at Pavan\u0026rsquo;s place in Adyar that night. We left at about 9:30 pm and reached his house at around 00:30 am. I was tired as a pig and believe me, I\u0026rsquo;ve never slept that well for quite a few days :-) ! Next day morning at around 8:00am we walked down to the Besant nagar beach. This was just about a km from where Pavan stayed. To be frank, I never knew Chennai could be this beautiful! In contrast to The marina, The Besant nagar beach was pretty clean and the ambience was definitely breath taking. It was a wonderful sight to see the fishermen catching fish with magnanimous nets that early in the morning. This is something that you simply don\u0026rsquo;t get to see in a place like Hyderabad :-) Vairavan joined us a few minutes later and we had a great time together. The Horse ride on the beach shore gave a silver lining to the beach episode :-) .\nThe rest of the day was spent in Burma bazar with Abi and Adi scouting for Movie and Game CD\u0026rsquo;s . This is one place that they just don\u0026rsquo;t miss out when they go to Chennai! :-) . We could manage to have a brief stop by at Spencer Plaza where Rohit met us and even before we realised, it was 4:00pm. Our return train was at about 4:45 pm so we had to rush to the Station. Reached Hyderabad today morning and everything is back to square one now. Nevertheless, Two days of travelling, a few hours in the scenic beach and recollecting those innumerable wonderful memories have rejuvenated my mind :-) .\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/02/04/with-the-power-vested-in-me.../","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJust a couple of moments together and all those memories strike you like a wild torrent from no where.

But for them , I never would have realised how logically easy dancing was. I\u0026rsquo;ve no inhibitions in jumping on a DJ floor, I\u0026rsquo;ve done it several times before, but then a performance before a massive crowd is something which I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even have dreamt of doing.

It\u0026rsquo;s just about twining the loose threads now. A few days of late nights after my french thingy and things should fall in place.

In technology, if there\u0026rsquo;s something that really interests me, its only UNIX and Open Source. I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet got into the nitty gritty of things.

I wonder why it\u0026rsquo;s always the other way round for me. Above 450m from the ground, where you have no control on yourself and have vested your dear life to the hands of some unknown person is definitely not a place to plan you next move!\nI\u0026rsquo;d been to Bangalore yesterday and it turned out to be just for Para-sailing! :-) I left from Hyderabad on Saturday evening at about 3:30 pm. I was fortunate enough to get tickets by the state bus service, which by itself was quite surprising given the short notice that I had. Sheku, Shilpa and Vairav were to join me in Bangalore. Reached B\u0026rsquo;lore on sunday morning by about 6:00 am and made it to the Infy Ecity campus by around 7:30 am. Vairavan had come down from Chennai the previous day and could arrange some accommodation. He, his friend Sharada and myself left for silk board by 8:00 am. Sharada had to pick up some stuff from her house so both of them got down midway and promised to get back ASAP. I\u0026rsquo;d asked Shilpa and Sheku to be there at the Silk board bus stop by 7:30. Poor sheku was well before time :-) ! You should have seen the reaction on their faces the moment I was there! Not finding the other two added just some more adrenalin in their bodies :-) . I\u0026rsquo;m not to be blamed for that ;-) !!\nSheku, Shilpa and I left for KR puram. by a 500D bus service and reached the cable bridge bus stop in about half an hour. This is just a few stops after Marathalli. It was already quarter past nine and both of us were desperately looking for a hotel to grab a bite before we left for Hoskot where the Para sailing was to take place. All we could find was a guy selling hot idlis on a push cart. Each got a plate and gobbled all that we could. I bet even a three star hotel can\u0026rsquo;t beat that taste!\nNone of us really knew how to get to Hoskote, so we placed a call to Anand who was handling the event that day and got the requisite directions. We had to board a 317 bus from the KR puram cable bridge bus stand and get down at a bus stop called Koti. This place is about 12kms from KR Puram and you get to find quite a few buses. The most prominent landmark ( atleast all of what I noticed ;-) ) of this place is a BP Petrol bunk and a Punjabhi shack dhabha on either side of the road. We thought it would be wise to wait for Vairavan and Sharada and then move together .\nThey did end up coming in about twenty minutes and all five of us started walking to the main parasailing area. You need to walk over a short bridge, take the immediate left and keep walking in the direction where you get to see Parasails in the air! - These are the directions that was given to us by Anand. Hell! I don\u0026rsquo;t blame him. That was the best he could provide! :-) . Topographically , locating our destination was pretty interesting! :-) The river bed was almost dry and we had beautiful black and white buffaloes to guide us all through the path. Reached a place where the path ceased to take us any further. Fortunately this is where we caught a glimpse of one of the Parasails in the air and in a matter of about ten minutes we reached the place where the the remaining folks from AdVentura were seated.\nWe had to fill declaration forms before we could get the gear on us and shoot up in the air. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s just a formality that comes with any adventure activity. Shilpa was the first to get hooked with the sail. She\u0026rsquo;d done it before so she was pretty cool with that. Then was my turn. I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly afraid of heights, But then butterflies somehow manage to create a flutter once a while. That\u0026rsquo;s where the real thrill is! :-) There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of , given the expertise of the team that was conducting the event but then emotions is something that is under your control! Anyways, this is how it works, you are given a proper gear to hook yourself up with the para-sail. A long strong chord is tethered to the sail to which you are hooked and the other end is jacked on to a car. Once you\u0026rsquo;re all set, the guy accelerates forward and your up in the air even before you realise what\u0026rsquo;s happening! :-)\nThe real fun is in living every moment of your flight! Keep your eyes wide open , stare into the sky, look at people down there , shout even if you are not scared or the best thing to do would be to fancy having to jump from that height if nothing else scares you ;-) ! The initial tug that you get when the vehicle accelerates is just fabulous! The very feeling of helplessness and total sense of your surroundings at a height of about 400m is something which just cannot be explained! You need to experience it! Once in air , it\u0026rsquo;s not much of a scare. So as i told you, the best thing to do would be to visualize the chord to suddenly break loose..the rest is your imagination! :-) . Vairavan, Sheku and Sharada soon were done with! It was real fun to watch Sharada . Poor female, real light that she was, had lotsa trouble trying to come down. Heavy gusts of wind added to her misery! She was defying gravity in the real sense! :-)\nThe journey back home to Hyderabad was as much good. Subash managed to get a ticket booked for me. It happened to be one right in the front. Watching the driver zip on the roads at high speeds, skillfully maneuvering through the night traffic was just great. It kept me awake for the most part of the journey. I\u0026rsquo;ve traveled quite a few times by bus but was always seated somewhere at the last.\nAll in all, it was a fabulous weekend. Thanks to Adventura, Anand and Suma in particular for organizing the whole event. One thing off my checklist of things to do. Gotta try river rafting next!\nShall upload the pics and videos as and when Vairavan or Shilpz zips them to me!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/01/15/up-in-thin-air-parasailing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are so many places and occasions where you can sit back, relax and rethink on your strategy and future course in life.

Fiesty was running on the remaining 40Gigs. Last week during the installation I\u0026rsquo;d configured the setup to create a Primary ext3 partition instead of making it a logical one.That was what was leading the setup to freeze! Surprisingly I was never warned during the initial stages. Anyways, I fortunately happened to notice the goof up this time and then the rest of the Installation was a breeze! Flat 10 minutes and I had Gutsy live and kicking! :-)\nThe first thing I\u0026rsquo;d looked for after logging in was to check out the classy desktop effects that Gutsy comes bundled with. But to my dismay the OS threw up messages telling me Advanced Desktop effects could not be configured. It didn\u0026rsquo;t even specify the cause. A bit of Googling brought out the hidden mite - My Hardware settings were blacklisted since it couldn\u0026rsquo;t support both video rendering and classy desktop effects at the same time. But then I just wanted to find a workaround to get things working. Finally I happened to find one in the Ubuntu Forums itself. All I had to do was to deactivate the Hardware config. check that Compiz by default does when initiated. This could be done by running the following command in the terminal.\nmkdir -p ~/.config/compiz/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo SKIP_CHECKS=yes \u0026raquo; ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager\nOnce that roadblock had been dealt with I only had to install the Gnome Compiz manager through the Synaptic package manager. Synaptic installs are cakewalks. All relevant dependencies get installed and broken installations are pretty rare. Installation of the Compiz manager led to the creation of a Preferences tab in the Advanced Desktop settings. This is where real FUN starts. A bit of tweaking and you have your desktop at your whims! I\u0026rsquo;ll probably let the pictures do the talking!\nThe Workaround explicitly mentions that crashes are prone to occur if both video and Advanced Desktop settings are run at the same time. So keep in mind to get back to the default settings when you plan to watch videos on your Gutsy. A pain but still worth it! :-)\nThere\u0026rsquo;s still a lot more to explore ( or should i say exploit :-) ) .

It was a common belief that syllabus in Math was much better in SSC schools when compared to ICSE ones and since my bro was in his seventh by then, people in my family wanted him to shift over to the state syllabus By default I had to tag along as no one ever trusted me, thanks to my consistent flunking in quite a few papers. But for Math, English and Biology, I barely managed to pass other subjects. The moment I got to know I\u0026rsquo;d have to write an admission test to gain an entry into the school I was all tears! They wanted to test my hindi. Something that I was extremely bad at then :-) .\nMom , Bro and I went over the Princi\u0026rsquo;s office. My cousin who was then studying in that school introduced us to her. Both of us were asked to go into separate rooms. I was given a paper and asked to write a composition on \u0026lsquo;Gomaatha-The cow\u0026rsquo;. This was one standard composition that I\u0026rsquo;d been learning by rote for quite sometime in JGHS. Nevertheless, my written hindi was pathetic! Real pathetic! Bharathi Miss , the then Vice Princi evaluated my sheets right in front of me. I still remember that \u0026lsquo;WTH!\u0026rsquo; reaction on her face when she was skimming through my composition. :-) . I was half expecting to get rejected and I wanted to in fact. The very thought of meeting new people, getting accustomed to a new environment and all that was no way close to appealing. All I wanted was to get back to the 5th bench of class VI-A the next day. But unfortunately Bharathi\u0026rsquo;s mind worked the other way round - If my bro was intelligent , there\u0026rsquo;s a high probability that his sibling would do just the same with some help. How could SVHS afford to lose such brilliant students? They\u0026rsquo;re in!. She comes out and tells my mom that though my Hindi was real bad, I\u0026rsquo;d be given admission.

We were asked to write a short composition using a couple of basic sentences on some famous personality and even before I could pool in the Je\u0026rsquo;s, Il\u0026rsquo;s, fait\u0026rsquo;s, suis et al, my thoughts started drifting back to that particular day 10 years back.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Cow and I!"},{"content":"I picked an auto today to get back home from Vidyanagar.

All was fine but for the way the priest was reciting the mantras. I bet I could recite it better than him! It makes me think at times, how pathetic todays religious system in India is. Everything boils down to money! I very much know how important liquid cash is, but then one is at least supposed to do justice to what he\u0026rsquo;s doing. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen quite a few ceremonies happening at my own house . Years before, I remember pujas were performed in depth and at times lasted till the evening. But now it\u0026rsquo;s all done in a just an hour.The pujari gets a zillion calls amidst the ritual and he attends it with all pleasure handing over the reins to his secretary (I really don\u0026rsquo;t mind using that word).\nI learnt the vedas for almost a year and I really did enjoy reading it. This was during my first year of engineering. What I was interested then was not in what I was saying, it was the way in which it was recited that lured me to it. The rhythmic rise and fall of the sloka with regulated breath and the chorus that reverberated through the room was just heavenly. I was and am still an Atheist. But still I did try to find the meaning of what I was actually reciting. The Guru\u0026rsquo;s reply was this, some things are just not to be understood or are beyond comprehension. Something that I still cannot digest! The only reason I respect him is for his mastery over the recital of the slokas and the way he expresses it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s always a fine line between Doing what one believes in and Believing what one\u0026rsquo;s doing. It\u0026rsquo;s a matter of how you take it. It\u0026rsquo;s been almost seven years that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been to a place of worship. I see no reason why I have to. Even if I\u0026rsquo;ve been, when compelled by a couple of my friends, I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced no sense of relaxed atmosphere in the ambience. In fact there\u0026rsquo;s not one moment in the last seven years that I really felt like going to the place for clearing my conscience or relieving my tensions.\nWhat I don\u0026rsquo;t understand is if people believe so much in rushing to a temple to relax and pray before pushing off to their office; doing that ceremonious action with their hands when they come across a religious place while travelling in a vehicle or just drop by once a while, why don\u0026rsquo;t they do it the way the seers claim it has to be done? And if you tell me time is the factor. Please.. give me a break! If I though being an atheist, can recite a few slokas much better than quite a few people; can find time to ( if I want to that is!) go to spend some quality time at the place, why can\u0026rsquo;t you spend some time to do things the way it is to be righteously done?\nP.S: These are just my thoughts and I have no intentions to hurt your religious sentiments. In no way am I trying to influence the way you think or trying to put someone down or some religion down.

With time the human brain gets so well accustomed to the intermittent loss of control that it fails to track those transitions. But the moment the transition is sensed you get so wary of the happenings, that you catch yourself doing things with extra care. Something that was mundane suddenly gets thrilling for no reason at all and at times you wonder why at all it\u0026rsquo;s happening in the first place!\nThey\u0026rsquo;ve been quite a few instances when I\u0026rsquo;ve caught myself failing to understand why I\u0026rsquo;ve gone to a certain place without any reason and times when I fail to remember why I\u0026rsquo;ve been to the place. But the moment I\u0026rsquo;m back to the place where I\u0026rsquo;ve started from, I realize why I had to be there. That makes me ponder if the occurrence of an activity has got something related to the status of mind at a particular location when you were reminded of initiating it. Why else would you suddenly recollect what has to be done when you get back to that location? It could probably be that, that the ambience in some intricate manner influences your flow of thoughts and hence in a way deems to serve as a backup resource in case you fail to recollect why and what you are supposed to be doing. Your sub-conscious mind relates the ambience, the thought process and the activity and tries to form a coherent relationship and when that fails, you\u0026rsquo;re lost.\nOn the other hand, there\u0026rsquo;s always this repulsive quotient that comes into effect intermittently.

Next time you visit Bangalore,make it a point to visit this spot. It\u0026rsquo;s about 80 kms from the main city and believe me after having gone that far, you wont regret your decision! Sangam is in the Kanakapura district and is the confluence of the Cauvery River and the Arkavathi river in Karnataka. The river in its southward bound flow sqeezes down through a narrow gorge to reveal a breathtaking sight. The thundering sound of water and the sight of it gushing down in all might is something that I\u0026rsquo;d never forget! . This place where the river passes through the rocks is called the Mekhedatu. (The reason for it being called so still intrigues me. Mekhedaatu in kannada, literally translates to \u0026lsquo;Goat jump\u0026rsquo; . Though the rocks were pretty close , A goat definitely couldn\u0026rsquo;t have jumped across the gorge. Anyways, names are names! :-) ) .\nThe road to this spot is a winding path through the scenic rural parts of Kaarnataka. You need to take a turn somewhere at the end of the Kanakapura town and navigate through the narrow paths. You\u0026rsquo;d come across several villages en route Sangam. Most of these villagers eke out their living by adopting sericulture. You get to find silkworms being bred in almost every house!! Once you reach Sangam, you need to take a boat ride to the other bank to get to Mekhedaatu. ( I heard people could walk across to the other bank by easily wading across the waters of the Arkavathi river dueing off seasons! ) . The boats used for ferrying, are not like the normal boats. These are circular in shape and their base is layered with Tar to keep it afloat. A guy ferries you across to the other side of the river for about forty bucks. Midway he swirls the coracle a couple of times giving you those few enchanting, thrilling moments of drowning! :) . A bus worthy of being sold as an antic awaits you on the other bank! Pay him another 40 bucks for a rickety ride down the kuccha road to Mekhedaatu. Oh did I mention? The bus has got no headlights . The route is mesmerizing and the driver leaves no stone unturned to make the ride less comfortable! A few things are always good the bad way-You\u0026rsquo;d remember it for a lifetime :-) !\nOnce you reach the spot where the bus can no longer move forward, you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to walk down a narrow rocky path. A turn round the corner and you get to know what exactly nature is!! I bet you\u0026rsquo;d never want to get back from there! The magnanimous force with which the water gushes through the gorge has led to the rocks to have developed extremely deep pits in the surroundings! One wrong step and you\u0026rsquo;d go up all the way to Heaven in all pristine glory! :-) .\nWho says trips need to be well planned? I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure had we chalked out a plan and pre decided everything we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have enjoyed as much! Weekends back in Infy bangalore were pretty somber. But for the visits to the labs and probably a shuttle to the city now and then, most of the days were spent lazing in the rooms. Probably all this drove us to nuts to such a large extent that we suddenly started planning a trip to Coorg. But then other folks out here wanted to go to a place that was close by to avoid getting really tired by the time they get back on the Sunday evening. So we decided to go to Nandi Hills. Why we cornered on Nandi Hills, we still don\u0026rsquo;t know but where we ended up going turned out to be a stupendous location.\nFor no apparent reason, the Java stream trainees invariably have a test every monday. So most of their weekends were as such spoilt. Fortunately the last weekend was one of those lucky \u0026rsquo;ends when both the streams, Java and Mainframes were relatively free. But then it was already a friday and we had no much time to chalk out a plan and do things meticulously. About 20 of us were game for a trip to Nandi hills. None of us had been there before but we\u0026rsquo;d heard sunrise thers was just great!\nWe\u0026rsquo;d arranged a Mazda for the next day and planned to leave at about four in the morning to be there on time to watch the Sunrise. We fell for the assurance given by the Travels guy and were all ready by 3:30am before Gate 6. This was where we were supposed to wait for the Mazda. But as things would go, there was someone who wanted to doze in glory that fine morning and Unfortunately it happened to be that heavenly soul who had to sit behind the wheel and drive us to the hills! That screwed nut ended up at Gate 6 only at around 5:30 am :( !! We had to settle down for a sunrise view on a section of NH7 and kept moving towards Nandi Hills. The way up the hills is very narrow and given the ghat description, is pretty dangerous. A couple of us hopped on to the roof top of the Mazda. There are very few things more thrilling than sitting atop a vehicle roof when driving uphill a ghat :-) ! We Reached Nandi Hills about 7:00am and kept hopping by and posing for snaps on rocks labelled \u0026lsquo;DANGER\u0026rsquo; ! :-) . Nandi Hills is no wonder a scenic spot, but then I\u0026rsquo;ve been to quite a few places at high altitude and probably because I had extremely high expectations on Nandi Hills, I failed to really take in the scenic view of the place. By 10:00 am most of us were sort of bored being in the same place. People were of the opinion we\u0026rsquo;d get back to the city and while away time. It was already 12:00 before people came to a consensus . This was when fortunately Shubz came up with the Idea of going to Sangam! Had a sumptuous lunch in a Roadside Dhabha and defying the drivers requests not to travel that far, we got to sangam by around 5:00pm. We Couldn\u0026rsquo;t spend much time at Mekhedaatu because we had to get back to the boat ferry before dusk for fear of travelling in a bus with no headlights!! We managed to leave Sangam by around 7:00pm . The way back to ECC was pretty long. With all energy exhausted none of us were in mood to chat. Not one of us spoke even while having dinner!!\nYou\u0026rsquo;d find a couple of pics of the outing in my flickr. Got to upload others.

Fortunately my holy brain doesn\u0026rsquo;t activate the clause when I\u0026rsquo;m at the wheel! I love Speed as much as I love Sleep in motion. It\u0026rsquo;s just the feeling of escalated sense of enormous brain activity that drives things in me. I remember ramming into a wall and falling into a small gutter, just a few days after learning to cycle. I was actually trying to match speeds with a guy on a moped who\u0026rsquo;d sneered at me. Being a pretty short tempered guy then, I had all the adrenalin pumped to sort things out . Lost my wits, lost my senses and finally ended up losing my control. Dr. Hakunamatata once said \u0026lsquo;You never lose in life! Everyplace you lose, you gain something really worthwhile.

Secondly,There\u0026rsquo;s someone present around you,who knows what\u0026rsquo;s what and the repercussions of every minor flaw that may occur .Thirdly-Follow your instincts (only after you follow the above two rules :-) )\nTrekking and Adventure sports is what I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to be into , five years down the lane; Paragliding and Sailing to be preicse. But it\u0026rsquo;s all a function of money , time and more so the right training place. I\u0026rsquo;ve Cornered on a few people who\u0026rsquo;ve been in the field for long and are really experienced in their respective fields.

I\u0026rsquo;ve already seen the Malayalam and the Tamil versions of this film, so the movie wasn\u0026rsquo;t something that really interested me. What was more interesting is the way the Black ticket modus operandi that the theater management deploys.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re basically three types of tickets that are sold in this theater Rs30, Rs50 and Rs60. These are probably the rates which the Karnataka Goverment has set for medium rung theatres in the state ( I\u0026rsquo;m not a movie buff so I\u0026rsquo;m quite oblivious of the current rates :) ) . The show was at around 4:30 pm and we\u0026rsquo;d reached the theater well ahead of time at around 2:30 just to get the tickets. They were about fifteen people ahead of us in the queue and we were pretty sure we\u0026rsquo;d get the tickets this time. By the time we reached the counter, we were told that only four thirty rupees tickets were available and all other tickets were sold out. The hall as far as I know has no advanced booking facility and no internet booking. It is spacious enough to seat atleast 150 people and this guy here says he\u0026rsquo;s sold out all the tickets!! A few minutes later, the same guy comes out with a bunch of tickets in his hands , stands near the gate and starts selling the tickets for almost double the cost!!\nI do agree Black tickets are sold in almost every theater but never to this extent. And here the worst part is that the management by itself is organizing it!! Tickets in the so called A grade thatres like PVR and INOX are around 200 bucks so the public doesn\u0026rsquo;t even mind paying about 100 bucks to watch the movie in these theatres. Everyone gains\u0026hellip;the management in selling the tickets at a higher rate to a tout, the tout in making around 20Rs per ticket by selling it to the public and the public in purchasing the ticket at half the price when compared to those in A Grade theaters. At the fag end, it\u0026rsquo;s all about watching the movie!!\nTrue, Everyone\u0026rsquo;s bothered about his money. But people don\u0026rsquo;t realize what effect this has on their overall cost of living. The government perceives this to be a pointer of the status of living of the public and increased rates are benchmarked. The same logic was put forth by a friend of mine for the high real estate value in Bangalore or any metropolitan for that instance. A land owner having a couple of batchelors staying in his quarters raises the house rent giving due consideration to the fact that the amount is shared. A rise of about 2k isn\u0026rsquo;t really a pinch in the wallet for a group of about four to five people staying together in a metro. The owner gets an increased income from practically no increased investment of his and the tenant is, if not more happy, contented to stay at the same location for some more time. Both sides stay happy for sometime till the next cycle of change and then it\u0026rsquo;s the same state of affairs again.\nAnyways! How does it matter to me or you\u0026hellip;.(or does it? ;-) ). All that I wanted to do was to watch Bhul Bhullaiya. ( Should have given \u0026lsquo;Bourne Ultimatum\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Next\u0026rsquo; a shot instead :( ) .\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2007/10/21/kailash/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d been to a theater named Kailash yesterday to watch the movie Bhul bhulaiya.

Well, the reason is that I\u0026rsquo;ve been quite lazy till July 9th and post that I\u0026rsquo;ve controlled my browsing habits ;-) . I \u0026rsquo;ve joined Infosys as a Software Engineer this 9th and just 10 days into professional life, things have been pretty interesting. Not that I was not prepared for it , just that things turned out to be much better than what I expected them to be! :-)\nOur training location had initially been Mysore but just seven days prior to our departure we happened to get a mail from Infy telling us that the location has been changed to Bangalore. All of us initially were pretty much dejected. Infosys , I\u0026rsquo;ve heard is supposed to be the best in training freshers and their Global Education Center (GEC) at mysore is considered to be the hub for tech training with it\u0026rsquo;s world class facilities. Any person selected in Infy would love to have his training at their Mysore GEC. Still some things are just not in your hands.\nAbhi , Collin and I reached the Bangalore campus on 8th morning at around 10 am. After the formal verifications, We were directed to the Employee Care Center (ECC) , an accommodation that you could consider to be equivalent to a five star hotel. Met a few of our other classmates there and decided to have breakfast. Quite unaware of the Food courts then all of us opted to dine at the \u0026lsquo;La Terrace\u0026rsquo; restaurant in the GF of the ECC. Had a sumptuous meal there quite oblivious of the billing system. Only when we got our bills did we realise why we were the only people of Indian nationality there. Each of us were handed a bill of 100 bucks! :-) Least inclined to refute (and with no other option but to do so :-) ) we paid the bill, walked out and got back to our rooms. People soon started trickling in and by 12pm the lobby was packed with fresh trainees.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the campus like? Posed with this question quite a few of us got out of our rooms and cycled all through the vast 85+ acres of campus. The Bangalore campus or Infycity as it is called has an extremely beautiful campus, around six food courts , Two Gymnasiums, A beautiful swimming pool, a Basket ball and Volleyball court, Pool tables , Aerobics room and not to mention , quite a few magnificent buildings ( architectural splendor and non reasonability are the first things that would flash through your mind when you have a first look at them :-) ) . You\u0026rsquo;ve got cycles at your disposal at almost all buildings and you can pick any of them and park them at the parking lot of the destination block after you\u0026rsquo;ve used it.\nThe first week of the training was much into the formalities of Document verification, Signing of papers, Bank account formalities and an Induction program. Technical training has just started and things have slowly started picking up pace. With daily assignments and stuff, the noose seems to be slowly tightening. Nevertheless, life in the campus is extremely good. The day generally starts at around 5:30 in the morning. Rushing to the Food Courts by 7:30 and swiping cards before 8:00am is something that every trainee sees to it that he sticks to. Morning sessions which are generally up to 12: 30 pm are more or less theory sessions held in the huge auditoriums. The afternoon sessions are lab sessions and assignments are supposed to be completed in this time ( So has been the case till now). This goes on till 8:30 pm at times . Swipe out and rush to the food courts to have a relaxing dinner. We then get back to our rooms and after a fresh up cycle down to the Basket ball court. This is something that I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up after joining Infy. After an extremely tiring but wonderful two hour session in the game a few of us walk down to FC 27 and have something to drink. This is something that\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;s really good in the campus. Anytime you feel hungry or feel like having something, you can just walk down to the nearest Food Court and have a munch. It\u0026rsquo;s literally heaven once you\u0026rsquo;re back to your room. Just hit the bed and you\u0026rsquo;re ready for the next day\u0026rsquo;s routine.\nPresently I\u0026rsquo;m in Hyd for a small weekend visit.

Realising there was no point going in for a non graphical interface setup , I put in bay the Solaris installation. I had a FC4 DVD and I tried installing that . You wont believe me! The whole installation got done in just over 10 minutes! :-) The main reason for installing FC4 was that I direly needed a net connection in the OS and my ISP gives me a provision for installation only though the Red hat Packet Manager ( RPM ) setup. Before I tried out the FC4 I forked in the Ubuntu 7.04 CD and tried booting from the Live CD to partition my HDD using the in built GParted software. But for some apparent reason the Live CD never booted and always led to the command prompt. Frustrated, I gave up and installed FC4 without properly partitioning the HDD.\nA few days later with a bit of googling I found that Ubuntut 7.04 had a bug that prevents it from booting on a SATA hard disk. They was a small fix up for that and once done, the setup was done with at lightening speed!

But finally when you are done with all of that troubleshooting and googling and finally setup up your machine with a flavour of linux. It\u0026rsquo;s sweet!! Pretty sweet!!\nWell, atleast now I can say, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a feel on how to install an Operating system. Exploiting it to your requirements and getting a hang of working on it is a totally different experience. Nevertheless as I told you it all depends on how you take your experience. You get bogged down once and you take the hit, your done for good! But then you recuperate and strike back to take more hits, you learn stuff!\nAnd now , the million dollar question\u0026hellip;Why Linux? Well, I learnt using linux for fun and just for the heck of experimenting, though now it does serve other purposes too. When I happen to tell people I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a flavour of linux and ask them to try it too, more often than not, I get the response - \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine with Windows dude. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to change.\u0026rdquo; Well, there\u0026rsquo;s no point blaming them for that. Rather I\u0026rsquo;ll blame the rampant piracy in India. Had you been compelled to buy the Windows OS and given noother option I\u0026rsquo;m sure you would look out for other cheaper equivalents. Linux is FREE! It\u0026rsquo;s open source, It supports most of your hardware devices, It\u0026rsquo;s got a huge support database, It\u0026rsquo;s got a huge fan community, It is in no way inferior to any Windows OS, It\u0026rsquo;s robust, It\u0026rsquo;s just as easy to use as any other Operating system once you get a hang of it, It\u0026rsquo;s much livelier, It\u0026rsquo;s highly interactive, It looks much more appealing than any other OS and I\u0026rsquo;ve heard it\u0026rsquo;s much more secure. What else could you want from an Operating System? I believe that justifies!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2007/06/22/linux/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve upgraded my old system (the 440 Lx) to a brand new Core2Duo !

All was fine till the end of the examination but when we reached the rooms ppl started slowly lamenting of the heat and finally withdrew from the plan! :-( Got pissed to the core!!\nAt around four pm, Calvin and I decided to leave to Hyd. We only had the option of leaving by bus. We generally take a bus to Tirupathy and from there a Hi-tech to Hyd. For some reason this time we decided to go via Chennai. The Bus service at Chennai to Hyd is sometime around 8:00 pm. So we had ample time! We boarded a 76BExpress service from the Kanchi Bus station and started placing calls to people in the hostel just to complete the final formalities! Was actually still fuming :-(\nThe bus had just come out of the town outskirts when I realized I hadn’t called the Hindi trio [Black Bombay, White Bombay and Rahul ]. The moment I called them, they started abusing me literally :-) !! Somehow they managed to change my mind and I got down at Meenakshi Hospital. Well the bombayz had told me that they were planning to have a party that night in the hostel ,that was the main reason why I’d changed my mind! :-) The Bus driver was kind enough to accede to my request! (Being an Express service he is not supposed to stop in b/w ). This was about five kms from the University and on the NH7. Rahul said he’d be there within ten minutes. Calvin carried on in the bus to Chennai as he said he had some important work to attend to. True to his word, Rahul picked me up and I was in the Hostel in twenty minutes.\nWe pooled money for the night’s party from the Hostel inmates. Bala and the Bombayz went over to the town and managed to get Fire crackers, a huge cake and Appy packs! The Administrative Officer was invited .He’d come with his grand daughters. Was fun with the kids around! All the crackers were burnt by 12:00am. After the Cake cutting, distributing and not to mention the smearing, people started getting back to their rooms. Junior’s had their Semester exams the other day so they got back to their rooms pretty soon. A few other non active members of our batch hit their bed after munching their share of cake. With nothing much left to do even we guys got back to our rooms. It was then that Bala removed the Rocket’s that he’d hidden. Around ten of us and a couple of juniors moved over to the Hostel terrace. The girls’ hostel was about 400yards away from our hostel! So you could very well expect the target! :-) . Hit the bed sometime around two o’clock. Man! We had a blast that night!\nEvening the previous day I again proposed a trip to an amusement park. Rahul readily accepted and we decided to go no matter what! Somehow we compelled Black Bombay ,SGP and Akka too. They reluctantly accepted. We initially thought of going to MGM but later for no apparent reason decided to go to Kishkintha! Both are amusement parks, MGM being much away from the city when compared to Kishkintha. I had to dump my bag in CMBT ( the main bus terminus in Chennai ) as I decided to leave directly to Hyderabad that day and I didn’t want to carry the luggage with me to an amusement park. Our plan was that I would wake Rahul and leave to CMBT at around 6:00 am. Rahul would wake the other guys and they would come to Tambaram by 9:00. I would come down to Tambaram from CMBT by 9:00. But as luck would have it, the Express bus which I was traveling by broke down mid way and I had to catch another bus to CMBT. Tried dragging Sooz to join us but he had some other important work to attend to. It was 10:00 by the time I reached CMBT! I deposited my air bag in the Cloak room and got myself a ticket to hyd for that night’s service. Nevertheless, Rahul, Black Bombay, Akka and SGP got delayed too for no apparent reason. We managed to meet at Tambaram only by around 12:00pm. Kishkinta was around 10kms from there. We took an auto and reached the park by around 12:30 .Bought the tickets and sat on a few rides. Kishkintha is much smaller compared to MGM and has much lesser rides too. We had a feeling that we should have been to MGM. But soon realized that since we were already here, there was no point lamenting!\nThe water pool here was definitely different from the one’s we’d seen at other parks. Spent much of the time lazing, sliding and not to mention ogling! :-) There were only two attractions at Kishkintha that I feel makes it a different amusement park. One is the Chennai Kuttralam. This is cave sort of entrance which sprinkles water in miniscule streams on you when you walk by and the other is an artificial waterfall which Kishkinta has developed to emulate the Kuttralam falls in Kerala. I’ve no words to explain how good the emulated falls was! The very beauty of the falls left us so very enthralled that we forgot taking snaps there!\nQuite aware that travel back to CMBT would take me around an hour from Tambaram, I wanted to leave a bit early. Moreover I didn’t want to take any sort of risk with Chennai Traffic! :-) SGP and I caught the 18:10 service from the park to Tambaram. Black Bombay, Rahul and Akka got back to business! You know what I mean! :-) I reached CMBT just in time to catch the Hyd Hi-tech. Placed a call to Rahul and was to hear that they were not successful in their mission! :-) They’d picked the 18:50 service and were on their way back to Kanchi! Had an extremely comfortable journey back home! Literally, My last trip back home after my Engineering !\nAll set and done, I had a wonderful end to my Enggineering life! Thanks to that one call that I’d placed to the Hindi trio!

Nevertheless, just keep reading.

Oh Yes! The one which people claim to be on one of the forked out roads of the National Highway connecting Chennai and Bangalore, or rather the Uiversity just 75kms from Chennai. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard people giving out wonderful descriptions of the exact location in varied forms. No doubt they are right and probably the reason why I tend to agree with them is that the moment you blurt the word Kancheepuram from your mouth, you only get questions on Sarees , Swamigals and Temples. I\u0026rsquo;ve had enough with the three and am least interested in any of them! :-)\nMy brief stint at Kanchi for the past four years has been quite an interesting episode. Not really in the sense you think, but more or less, you and I are on parallel lines. This is one place where even Eighty year olds are called \u0026ldquo;Akka\u0026rdquo; and fifteen year old guys get to be called as \u0026ldquo;Anna\u0026rdquo;. Believe me; I\u0026rsquo;ve never called my own people with the tags attatched till I happened to be in Kanchi. (I don\u0026rsquo;t do it even now, that\u0026rsquo;s totally a different case :-) ) These words have lost their true meaning and probably have become just descriptive words to catch the attention of the other person.\nOne very good feature of the town is its Connectivity with the mainland of Chennai. You\u0026rsquo;ve got buses, plying almost every ten minutes to and from the central bus station. Kudos to the Transport Corporation\u0026hellip;what used to be a 2.5 hrs two years back drive is now only about 1.5 hrs from Chennai. Town traffic is more or less like any place in Chennai. You are prone to be cheated unless you have a brief idea of the place. Occasionally you happen to find Tonga’s on the road which operate on the same lines as the autos. I remember paying about four times the actual amount to a Tonga driver, the first time I got into one. :-)\nComing to food, if you\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking you\u0026rsquo;d be spending meagerly, let me tell you, you need to really pinch your purse for some good food. You\u0026rsquo;ve got hotels ranging from three star’s to the routine ones. But at the end it\u0026rsquo;s all the same. You end up paying more or less the same amount. Beside Hotels and restaurants you’ve also got a couple of Messes around, wherein you get only south Indian Stuff. You do get North Indian stuff too at a few hotels. Else you’ve always got a couple of Dhabas on the Highway roads. Unless you’re a glutton, you would end up spending sixty to seventy bucks on general days and about hundred bucks in summers.\nOn more outstanding features of this place is its climate! Just one day, and you’ll know why people are jet black in this place! During summers you’re just out of your bathroom after a shower and you see yourself sweating; you’ve just left you’re room and walked a few yards, you’re shirt is almost drenched in your sweat. Carrying Towel’s instead of Hankies would probably just help you keep dry :-) . On the other hand, in winters you get average temperatures of about 10 degrees. Moving around at nights is something that you’d love to do. Rainy season is just the same as in any other place. Just that it’s a bit more! It rains cats and dogs! :-)\nThe best part of this place is the roadside tea stalls that you get to find in almost every nook and corner of a street! The taste that you get here in the Coffee’s and Tea’s concocted by them is just unmatchable! There’s this place called Kadhir kadai ( not sure what the name board reads, nevertheless that’s the name we put :-) ) that my friends and I have been visiting for the past two years almost daily. You need to taste his coffee to believe me!\nSocial security is not much of a concern here. There’s this place called Koneru Kuppam , just across the railway line . I’ve been told this is the second most dreaded area in Tamil Nadu (after Madurai). Nevertheless, I haven’t come across any unprecedented events in the past four years. Just that I’ve heard one of my seniors relating his episode of seeing a couple of men dragging the body of a man in a sac. This is an area that we need to cross every day to get over to the University and I personally haven’t seen anything that troublesome.\nAh! Now you ask me the question, what exactly is Kanchipuram famous for? My reply to that is Temples ,Swamigals and Sarees!. That’ll never change. It is like any other town.

Taking into consideration the burden that I have put on it for the past two years in terms of incessant formatting , wrong configurations, stupid setups and the like, It has proved to be quite a robust machine. Now loaded with two Operating systems and literally switched On whenever there\u0026rsquo;s a fleshy mass roaming in the house , I at times wonder how it still manages to pull along.\nMy date with computers started when we got one way back in \u0026lsquo;98 for the sole purpose of internet connectivity and e-mail. Then, I was only interested in one utility of it..games!! Me in front of the comp. would only mean the PC churning its processor to render graphics on the screen to add effects of the vehicle streaming on the highway , or the sound card tweaking out sounds for Mario or Dave hopping around :-) Never was i interested in learning stuff with the comp. Fortunately, once i joined Engineering things changed and Games have become my last priority. As days passed, I developed a fascination for the machine and slowly started realizing it\u0026rsquo;s true potential.\nMy Experimentations slowly started and the system responded with much more challenging problems. In my curiosity to understand stuff, I happened to delete quite a few windows files. Then started my bout with formatting. I never seriously counted how many times I\u0026rsquo;ve actually formatted the drive, but am sure the drive has been cleanly erased using fdisk at least couple dozen times or more (to tag on to the lower limit :-) ). Nevertheless, each episode has taught me that the previous format wasn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary and with time I started learning the tricks of the trade.\nInstalling Windows was always a breeze and frankly it has no real charm in the true sense of it. Setting up Xp from a non bootable, mid way through a 98 setup was the only hurdle I had to overcome to have windows upright in the system. Configuring the boot up and log off screen to one\u0026rsquo;s needs and other such small hacks could easily be learnt on the net. Playing around with Windows wasn\u0026rsquo;t any thrill at all.\nLinux was something that I\u0026rsquo;d been pretty afraid of two years back. Then,The word Linux used to reel back only one constant string of thoughts..commands commands and commands. One of my friends a bit geekier ( if u could call that) than me jumped in a bit earlier. It was then that I slowly started realising that Linux wasn\u0026rsquo;t really that tough to cope along with. Well for a newbie it definitely seems quite uninviting but once you get to have a hang of it..it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, actually much more interesting. The only difference between Windows and Linux, as I see it from a non technical aspect is that Windows feeds you with a silver spoon, Linux does not feed you at all! :-) It gives you the freedom or rather the choice to prepare the meal first and then do whatever you want with it. And that is how, i feel, things should be if you wanna learn stuff.\nSometime in my second year of Engineering I had the System all for myself. I had the freedom to handle it the way I wanted. I was the blacksmith and it was my mold. And moreover high time I had actually tried out something new, something different.I happened to get an FC3 installation diskette somewhere and wham! it went into my system\u0026rsquo;s drive, and again started my Formatting bout. I had no idea what an ext2 or ext3 or swap meant then. Had all sort of weird stuff like Grub , lilo, rpm, debian etc popping up. If i remember right, I spent almost a week trying to figure out how to partition the drive and set it up for Linux.Once that was done, installing Linux was a cakewalk. Just the same as a windows installation but for a few hiccups here and there.\nFrankly, I detested Linux the first time I set it up on my system. Had quite a few issues regarding configuring the desktop, mounting the drives and getting used to the Linux environment was definitely difficult. The mouse that i had then was a Logitech PS2 three button mouse. Linux just didn\u0026rsquo;t recognise the mouse and Connectivity to the Internet was another backdrop.I just didn\u0026rsquo;t understand how to configure the mouse and the net connection. The worst part was that for every minor issue that raised, I had to reboot back to windows and troubleshoot it and then get back to linux, and if that particular solution didn\u0026rsquo;t work out then the whole reboot process had to be repeated. This was a big time pain in the ass and more or less drained my zeal to get to have a hang of linux. I had even tried installing different flavours of Linux like FC4 , Mandriva, Ubuntu and Kubuntu. All issues used to get solved within a week or so but for the core problems of Connectivity and Mouse configuration. At one point of time I got pissed to the core and got back my system to cater only to Windows.\nLast month for reason\u0026rsquo;s unknown I installed FC4 again. This time I did some serious homework.I googled for stuff and did all that I could find regarding mouse issues for my grand old system\u0026rsquo;s configuration. None of the suggested tips worked and when I finally reached the peak of my patience an idea struck me like a bolt from the blue. It occurred to me that the mouse manual could be of some help. Man! you should have seen the reaction on my face when i realised that the mouse was just not built for Linux! :-) For almost a year, I\u0026rsquo;d been brainstorming for possible errors in the installation process , killing the Xserver, terminating the GNOME and crashing stuff like crazy and now I realize it\u0026rsquo;s all not just worth it! There definitely should be a way to get my PS2 mouse to work in Linux, probably write drivers for it and stuff but that part comes in later. Probably once i get to understand the kernel better.Well it was definitely hell of a relief to get a solution to my problem. I just went out to a nearby PC accessory store, bought a USB mouse for around 200 bucks and connected it to the USB hub and in moments the cursor moves in my Linux environment after about a year :-)\nWith renewed enthusiasm I now started searching for tips on configuring a net connection on my system. My ISP uses a Cyberoam client. which needs to be installed and configured before use. A bit of googling splits the beans and I get to know that the client for linux was developed for RPM and not for debian packages. Had I known this way back, I could have saved a couple of formats :-) . Anyways, tried out stuff here and there and finally when things just seemed to be working out the process ended up with something called a \u0026lsquo;segmentation fault\u0026rsquo; at the end of it. No leads from here. I pledged not to get back to Linux again :-)\nThe other day , Microsoft removed administrative previleges from my system. ( Had activated Automatic upgrades and probably Microsoft found the bad guy :-) ) I had to re-install Xp. Once installed, I had to set the connectivity in the OS. While pinging in the IP values in the client program it suddenly struck me that I was pinging in a value in the serverIP address box which seemed quite new. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t used the value for ages . Ideally, that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the case .I mean, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing with these numbers for almost a year now, trying to configure the client in Linux and they\u0026rsquo;r supposed to be impregnated somewhere in my grey cells for good\u0026hellip;Only then with some thinking out of the box did my holy neurons realise that I was actually pinging in the my terminal IP address in the place where I should have been giving my Server address . No wonder the bash was running into a segmentation fault! Nirvana at last! :-) .In my eagerness to set things right I directly restart my computer to enter Linux. Lo and behold ! What do I find? The Grub boot loader has been overwritten by the Windows MBR :-( . Huh!! back to square one. Logged back into Windoz and here I am googling my way to learn restore back the Grub! I remember coming across the procedure way back sometime. Didn\u0026rsquo;t care about it then! You realise you\u0026rsquo;re enlightened the moment you realize all around you there\u0026rsquo;s an illusion!! \u0026hellip;Strobing back on the leads now and the saga continues. I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure when I am gonna end up getting the Grub getting it\u0026rsquo;s shins kicked.All that I know is that I at least have something to look forward to while installing a fresh copy of linux.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll probably throttle my 20Gb harddrive to give me 10 Gb for my Linux installation, for now the demand is justified! :-)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2007/04/09/harnessing-the-power-of-the-440lx/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell, If you are still wondering what the 440LX is all about\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s the chipset that my PC has been thriving on for the past nine years : -)  , and is still kicking on.

Well, its not that i gave it a strong try, but that was my first attempt. Things really didn’t materialize and I kept myself occupied with other chores.\nI tend to get creative (rather idiotic) ideas only during my examinations. A few months back, sometime last year, my interest in instrumental music again reached it’s peak. I knew it was the most inappropriate time for me to start, because there were different Examinations fast approaching, but my enthusiasm got the better of me. I started fidgeting with a violin of one of my friend’s. I held it on my lap for a week or so, tweaking out discordant tones in variegated pitches. As such, I’ve never been a disturbance to my room mates :-) , but this was something that i just couldn’t avoid. I could never obtain the cadence which I craved for the violin to dole out, and being as such a guy with little patience, I never could compel myself to learn the basics right. It was like, i just wanted to challenge my friend ( who knew to play the instrument decently well) the very next day.Wish things worked my way!But most of the wishes that you yearn for are never satisfied.\nFrustrated, I just gave up within a week and started looking out for some other activity which I could spend my free time on. Days went by with life getting quite monotonous. In a casual chat with a few of my friends , for some reason , the violin issue sprung back and I was ridiculed at my failed attempt to learn the instrument. Well, the mistake was on my side , but still Mr. Ego crept in and I challenged Calvin that I would learn to play the violin by the end of my fourth year. That was just an impromptu statement and never ever had I even dreamt of learning it professionally.That episode aside, things were soon forgotten, and the routine monotony set in.\nA few weeks back I got back to hyd. and if not seriously, I at least started working on my project. With the work at least partially complete, I wondered if it would be really worthwhile if I could spend some time on any other activity besides reading novels , the project and of course sleeping :-) Well before setting off from Chennai I had decided to. optimally use the two months time I had. I was knee bent on getting back to Swimming , but with not many pools close to my house dropped the idea. One day something just reminded me of the challenge that I had posed to Calvin (rather what he had posed me ). But for some reason, I felt learning to play a violin, of all the instruments, wasn’t really quite appealing. I Placed a few inquiries here and there and finally got to know through Collin, that there was some place called Melowings which tutored people on instruments. I just went in for a casual inquiry and had a chat with the instructor. I was highly impressed by the way he spoke and was sure this was definitely not a place not to start learning a Guitar! Yep! you read it right…a Guitar!!\nI developed a strong desire to learn playing a guitar when I first set my hands on an electric one at Satyam Hyd. Shekar, one of my friends from Bombay had been to Hyderabad on a casual visit. One of his close friends, Pavan worked in Satyam Hyd. He had invited us for a weekend visit to his office and it was then that he had showed me how interesting an instrument can be! Then and there, I had decided to lay my hands upon a Guitar sometime in my life when things were slowly settling down.\nAt times I feel, only subtle challenges drives a person to make his life worthwhile. For instance, I learnt to swim just because I had to prove my sister wrong when she said I just wouldn’t pursue my airy desires.\nThis was sometime in my sixth class, when I, again for no particular reason, chose to go for a swimming course during my summer vacation. Dad enrolled me and my bro. in a close by Swimming pool. My brother was never interested in Swimming . But then he was compelled to, because Dad just didn’t want me to jump into water alone.Both of us had never ever been to a swimming pool before. There were quite a few kids in the pool besides us and just one guide.The guide instructed us to get into the pool and hold on to the support rod fixated to the walls of the pool. I in my childish excitement and my bro. just to be on my side, got into the pool. As more and more kids came in, we were asked to move further inside having a firm grip on the rod. We definitely perceived the level of water to be rising and assumed that it was because they were filling water in the pool [This as you would have guessed, and little did we then, was the inlet for the purified water].Little did we know that it was actually because we were moving unknowingly into deeper areas of the pool. At one stage both of us in panic, let go of the rod and started drifting away from the rod. We were literally drowning. I’m not sure if it was me or if it was him, who managed to drift towards towards the rod and get hold of it . We summoned all the strength we had and sprang out of the pool. The moment we got back home and doled out the episode to our sis and declared that we are never again going to have a look at a pool, she was in peels of laughter. The whole episode was forgotten in a few days and the summer hols just got over without anything really chirpy.\nNext summer again I felt I had to try swimming again, and this time my sis had a real valid point to say no. I could somehow persuade my dad to take me to another pool and enroll me.My bro was pretty busy with his exams then and he couldn’t join. The moment I saw the pool again, a shiver ran down my spine and just thought of going back home. But I was thankfully sensible enough to weigh my options and give swimming just another try before i make a fool of myself. I carefully went into the pool and just stood near the ladder. Didn’t budge an inch from there! For the whole two hours I was standing there just making myself accustomed to water, and when the bell was given, Phew!! I was the first one to jump out. With victory on my side I was on cloud nine. Just wanted to get back and show my beaming face to my Sis. But for her subtle challenge, I wouldn’t have overcome the phobia…\nAnd now let\u0026rsquo;s see how far the Guitar challenge rides the tempo..with my opponent wading the water in the same boat :-)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2007/03/10/the-reason-why-i-started-stroking-the-strings/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve had this keen desire to master at least one instrument before I finished my engineering.I tried my hands on the keyboard way back in my second year, and all that i could play on the instrument was the default pre-loaded songs in it! \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\")\"  /\u003e\n Well, its not that i gave it a strong try, but that was my first attempt.

Happened to come across this when sifting through my e-mails and thought I\u0026rsquo;d save and back post this for records\u0026hellip;\nDecember 12th 2006:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been almost six months that i\u0026rsquo;ve been placed in Infosys. But still at times, I find it hard to digest the fact that I hit the bull\u0026rsquo;s eye, right in the first shot! Having ideally no much expertise in coding languages, leave alone my own technical field, It\u0026rsquo;s been an admixture of both shock and surprises for me all the way through. If there had to be a core reason for me being placed, I would primarily attribute it to my Dad\u0026rsquo;s choice of enrolling me in the university that I am presently in. The reasons of enrolling me were way much different then. But does\u0026rsquo;nt everything happens for a reason?\nStudying in a college of pretty low repute, not a single thought had even occured to me all through the last three years about being placed in a firm through campus placements.I had just got back to the room after my GRE, when I heard rumours of our college being invited to Tagore Engineering college for an offcampus placement. This was the first time we heard of prospective placements, and not one of us believed it. Just one day before, the Off campus was confirmed and none of us were prepared for it, neither mentally nor intellectually! Just one reconcilement was, we got to hear that Infosys does not emphasize on technical expertise; but then sources were pretty much unreliable!!\nJuly 20th 2006\nThe day before the interview (rather the night before the interview!)\nOnly a handful of us had our resumes in hand. Formal wear and other requisites was an alltogether different question\u0026hellip;this was only our seventh semester beginning and placements was no where in sight! We had only a handful of systems operative and around fifty guys running berseck to get their resumes done first. A handful of guys prepared a rough draft of the resume and the rest of the pack just edited the same to develop theirs..the wierdest part of it! And when finally after a gruelling three hour tryst with our eye\u0026rsquo;s pondering over the resumes, we realized we needed hard copies and soft copies alone would do no good! We rushed over to a nearby cafe to get hold of a printer..a few of us got our resumes printer and a few couldn\u0026rsquo;t - The printer buckled! There was nothing more that we could do but go and purchase the formal wear\u0026hellip;10:00 at night.Finally we got back to our rooms buying what good clothes we could buy from the one and only one reasonable store in the silk town\u0026hellip;All set and done,we got back to our rooms and tried to finish off our last minute arrangements for an interview\u0026hellip;certificates, photographs, mark sheets and other papers.All the requisite documents set right ( oh yeah!!

The remaining battalion (including Me, Abhi, Doms ,Jamanujava, and Sexiter) left slowly at around 6:30.Had a hell of a time in the bus exchanging our thoughts on Infosys, major part of it out of our imagination! Placed calls to so called knowledgeable people to find out things about the firm and all that junky stuff\u0026hellip;Finally got a break when we got a call from Calvin telling us that he could trace out a cafe in Tambaram , enroute Vandalur. All pack of nuts finally met there and got the resume\u0026rsquo;s done.It was already 9:00 by then and the interview was supposed to start at around 9:30.We called up a few of our friends who had already reached the college and asked them directions.Ten of us hurled into two auto\u0026rsquo;s and finally happened to reach the college just on time..Once we were there..it was as if the whole SCSVMV campus had been there to receive us\u0026hellip;.we were the last set of guys to reach the center.We settled in the room allotted to us and the scrutinizing of people began. There was one gruffy person checking people\u0026rsquo;s attires and their certificates and filtering out people who did not satisfy the basic requirements. The drill was over in about an hour and we had to wait for about two hours for the aptitude test to begin. The test began at about 12:00 and in almost one and a half hour we were done with our test…Basic Puzzles and a very simple Verbal section. All students were requested to wait for the test results, which they said would be released in around two hours. Most of us had an unpalatable meal in the College canteen and just kept whiling away time for the next two hours. Gotman, Abhi, Doggy, Munna and myself walked over to the room where we had first sat and after the sumptuous meal almost entered into a refreshing siesta almost simultaneously. Probably a few minutes after we started swooning, the gruffy guy banged on the class room door and literally ordered us to get over to another class room where results of the written test would be declared. We managed to reach the room, still partially asleep.\nThings changed drastically after this. Looking at people in the seminar room, I suddenly experienced the butterfly syndrome!! The fear of failure!! Though I tried best to hold my composure, things didn\u0026rsquo;t really help…I just waded down to the rest room and got back only to find a larger troop inside…People seemed to be so very optimistic of being selected, I felt I was the odd one out. My inner feelings were so very averse , that I literally thought of spanking the guy beside me who was screwing me with his software language expertise. Fortunately, a couple of my college mates happened to take the seats in my row and things got better then.\nThe results were announced alphabetically college wise. When names from our college were read…I, for no apparent reason, felt the urge to hear my name in the list….who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t… the thought of a job in hand, a job in one of the reputed firms in India. Just out of college life… one of not much repute…Placement mattered. It would be like missing the treasure, right when the key is given to you…My grey cells were literally flushing with unnecessary thoughts ….Those, I believe are the moments and feelings that I would never forget in my life. My feelings gave way when I heard the name \u0026lsquo;Srikanth S Perinkulam\u0026rsquo; being read out. From then, I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt to respect the name…respect the way it is spelt .No doubt I was on cloud nine when I heard my name being read out…but then reactions had to be controlled to a very large extent as not many of my close friends were filtered in. Around fifteen of us were selected in the written test from about 180 from our University (170 and odd from the overall 2000). It was almost 6:30 by the time all the results were announced and the details of the next day\u0026rsquo;s Interview were given.\nThe college was in a quite remote location and there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any proper conveyance mode to the main city. A few lucky of us happened to hop into a bus and managed to reach the City. We reached back kanchi at about 12:00 midnight. I was the only one in my room to be selected and had an excruciating time facing my other roomies. Bruce lee was the one to tell me that quite a few of my batch mates had walked all the way back to the city from the remote college (around 4kms) literally crying over their ill luck. Only then did I realize how lucky I had been, and how much being placed in a company means to final years from a non reputed institute.\nJuly 22nd 2006\nSecond day of the recruitment drive\nEarly morning again at around 4:00 in the morning the alarm rang. But then I was the only one who had to get up. Was up and ready by around five. I knew having cleared the written test, getting through the HR shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a big hurdle. I had also heard Infosys HR rounds are a cake walk. Now, the ball was in my court and I knew it was up to me to give it the best short. Every word that I talk in the interview would decide my future and I had to do my homework. For one solid hour I sat and posed myself all probable questions I would face, prepared irrefutable answers, and rehearsed my body language mentally, visioning myself before the HR. That brief spell of ten to fifteen minutes would transform the way people look at me. The way I look at life, more so because I had to dismiss all allegations set up on me and this was one wholesome opportunity. That one hour is the only hour in my life till date that I have devoted hundred percent concentration to…This had to be a zero and a one…the result HAD to be a 1.\nWith spirits high, but still shell nervous, I walked over to the bus stand at around 6:30. Collin and Abhi had stayed back at Chennai the previous night at their relatives place and planned to come down directly the next day. Met Ravi Bhattrai and Alpana there and from then on had a quick journey to the college. Reached the college at about 9:00 am .The scrutinizing of certificates began again and we were asked to wait for our turn of HR. The SCSVMV batch was called to the first floor of the College building .The HR session was being held in different labs in the same floor. Most of us were seated adjacent to the Computer Lab. There was a camera on each corridor ceiling and I started wondering if at all videos were being streamed to some location in Alaska. My senses brought me back to reality and with this brief imagination started the damn jittery feeling again..…the fear of losing!! I realized unless I shred all unnecessary thoughts my one hour of hard work would take me no where. Just to divert my attention I roped in Ravi Bhattrai to a conversation and we started talking about every damn thing in the world…movies ,games, places, novels, tourist spots, girl friends and what not…and that did help us to a very large extent. Meanwhile Tiwari and Satish joined the conversation and things got quite relaxed. Turn by turn, people were called in to the Lab and interviewed. From what I heard from people coming after the interview, I pictured the room and the location of the HR. Plan B had to be rolled out now. I had to get acclimatized to the environs mentally. Just a few minutes after the dust in my mind settled, my name was called ….Srikanth S Perinkulam.\nThe Course of the HR Interview:\nThe moment I was led into the Lab, I had a quick survey of the seating arrangements of the HR\u0026rsquo;s. There were about six of them, all ladies, totally seated in three rows one behind the other and spaced equally all through the expanse of the lab. There was no means of one HR being able to listen to another HR\u0026rsquo;s conversation. Realising this did wonders to my confidence levels and my morale was boosted. It\u0026rsquo;s always easy to tackle one single person than two…Plan C need not be evoked!! I was requested to proceed to one HR seated in the left corner just as I entered the Lab.\nThe HR was facing the expanse of the hall, so I would not have to, during the interview phase\u0026hellip;just another morale booster!! I walked over to the table, turned around gave her a gentle false smile, asked her permission to sit and gently sat down, all the while having a sub conscious eye on my body language. She was the one to break the silence first and asked me for my resume. I took all my time in the world to gently remove my resume, giving her time to atleast have a glimpse of my well ordered and indexed set of certificates in the royal folder that I was carrying. The Table is not yours!! I had read in quite a few CSR interview booklets that my bro. had subscribed to for his preparation for CAT. Mindful of that I gently handed over the resume to her hand. The remaining major part of my interview was wholly dependant on my resume.\nThe first question she asked was why I\u0026rsquo;d joined a University somewhere in the outskirts of Chennai when we had wonderful colleges at hyderabad. I was well prepared for this question I have been answering it for the past three years to almost every Tom Dick and Harry I end up having a conversation and each time I\u0026rsquo;ve given an almost different reason. But this time I had to give an answer that could change the course of the interview to my side. All that I said was a direct blatant answer…I wasn\u0026rsquo;t academically strong in my 11th and 12th grade…gave a gasp for about three seconds and then said.. But then once getting exposed to the really competitive world in the course of my engineering I\u0026rsquo;ve turned stones. I\u0026rsquo;m probably not good at answering questions oriented theoretically, which require by rote knowledge. But I am pretty good in the practical point of view. All through the last three years I\u0026rsquo;ve been consistently receiving an S Grade in my Labs. Not to mention my good grades in other Theoretical subjects. Thanks to my mastery of the art of answering theoretical questions that my schooling has taught me…and we all know how examinations in India are held. With such a response I could explicitly bring out three main points of my personality a) My ability to learn from my experiences b) My Practical orientation in life c) My realization of the way of the society functions. With the very look on her face I could see I had given a justifiable answer and that the ball was still in my court….\nThe second question that she\u0026rsquo;d asked me was regarding my choice of Career. Why ECE ? I knew I had to keep in mind that I was applying for a software company and my long term goals that I would be mentioning soon should be in line with the requirements of the software industry. I very well knew this wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be a technical interview so I planned my response on those lines. My response was…I\u0026rsquo;ve always been interested in Computer Science and the primary reason for me joining ECE was because I felt I had the ability to learn the intricacies of coding In parallel to my regular course of study. I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt working with SQL and am quite conversant in UNIX commands. I do have a good understanding of the basics of coding languages like C and can work with HTML commands with ease. With such a response, as previously mentioned I\u0026rsquo;ve strengthened my stand as a good prospective software engineer and have exploited her question to the most possible extent besides revealing the languages or scripts that I am familiar with.\nThe next question was quite a common one that is generally asked in almost any Interview. Why Infosys? I responded saying it had the best Work culture, being both Social and competitive. I\u0026rsquo;ve got quite a few of my relatives working in Infosys and from what I hear from them and their previous experiences, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized it to be the best company to work with.\nThen she asked me a few questions on my industrial training sessions, what was taught there, and other questions such as Your Positive features, Negative aspects , Long term goals, Future plans , Hobbies and the like. The interview had been running for almost around thirty minutes for now and things weren\u0026rsquo;t looking like as if they were going to end. Finally she turned my resume over to the second page. I had listed myself as being a member of IEEE.. She asked me what role I played as an IEEE member. To this I responded as saying that I was an active member of the IEEE Chapter in organizing technical events and have met several prominent personalities (Doled out quite a few names…brought in people who never existed ! Boy, I still don\u0026rsquo;t believe I did that!) . I also emphasized on the skills that I had learnt whilst being a member such as working in a team, leading a group of people and the like…..The very expression on her face spelt that she had taken the bait. And that gave me further confidence…\nAnd then finally she gave a smile and told me to solve a small puzzle..I had to find a triangle in a maze of circles or something of that sort.Done with that she said \u0026lsquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve come to the end of the Interview. So Perinkulam do you have any questions?\u0026rsquo; I was on cloud nine, when I heard that the interview had come to an end but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really prepared for an answer to this question. So just to buy time I asked her when I could get to know about the results. She responded saying it should be out in an hour or so. Not able to frame any more questions impromptu, I just smiled and thanking her quit the lab gently and as soon as possible….and this is where I felt I could have taken a beating.\nNow all said and done, my Interview was done with and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really sure of the outcome. Machi, Sami and Ravi had to still complete their interview. Sami was thundered with a lot of Technical questions and was pinned by two HR\u0026rsquo;s. and Machi was\u0026rsquo;nt really confident in his approach. Ravi was chilling out and things were pretty calm after the HR session….We had a grueling three hour wait and finally at around 6:30 the results were declared. Abhi, Ravi, Madhu,Tiwari,Collin, Jai anand, Animesh, Hippo and I had cleared the HR. Aravind, Machi, Sami and Alpana were screened out. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of an elated air, for reasons mentioned before, but the moment we were segregated from them…Man!! You should have seen the ruckus that was created…people literally kicking each other like predator and prey!!! We had a post placement talk wherein they informed us about the offer letter, passport etc. etc.\nAfter such a tensed day, only at the end did I experience the real throbbing heart inside me. The feeling.. Mamoo tho bhi kuch banega life mein…crept in. I had developed a feeling that I\u0026rsquo;ve shattered all possible inhibitions in my mind , that I \u0026rsquo;ve overcome something that\u0026rsquo;s been a hindrance all through my schooling and college life. I\u0026rsquo;ve finally got at least one salient point on my list and the thought of the black mole in the family being me is weeded out. If there\u0026rsquo;s something that my success is to be attributed to, it would be to that solid one hour that I had spent in the morning. That one hour paid off!!\nIn Retrospect:\nAnd on this day when I turn 21, if I look back at my life in the year 2006, I realize how lucky I\u0026rsquo;ve been. On July 7th when I escaped unscathed after a horrible accident (involving the bus in which I was traveling and an Oil Tanker on NH7) which scooped 16 lives; On July 17th when I was almost sure I had to redo the GRE test and all through the test I was intent on clicking the EXIT button without even completing the test and on July 22nd when the Infy thing happened…I am sure Luck\u0026rsquo;s played a horribly vital role. Things have changed quite a lot this year….and with things, even I\u0026rsquo;ve changed….Or is it that Darwin\u0026rsquo;s theory - Survival of the fittest is being reinstated in my life…\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2006/12/11/as-i-turn-21/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d written this long post on my 21st Birthday when I didn\u0026rsquo;t even have a blog.

Having ideally no much expertise in coding languages, leave alone my own technical field, It\u0026rsquo;s been an admixture of both shock and surprises for me all the way through. If there had to be a core reason for me being placed, I would primarily attribute it to my Dad\u0026rsquo;s choice of enrolling me in the university that I am presently in. The reasons of enrolling me were way much different then.
