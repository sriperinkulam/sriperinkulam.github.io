Hiked up Izta via La Joya.
Quick work trip to Monterrey. Loved that those hills are right there in the city! Next time I&rsquo;m back here, I should plan to get here around a weekend. Food was great. Traffic was meh. Would strongly consider bidding for a position here - if/when one opens up!
M,S & S went to Oaxaca. They loved it!

FEB

Work travels took me to Merida and Managua. Managua had the vibes of any second tier southern Indian city.
Anton&rsquo;s Whiskey tasting was uber fun!
Girl scouts hike to Desierto Leones. Mike led the group. Was good to take a step back and be just a regular participant!
Piedra Herrada Monarch butterfly trip. Barely got to spot any Monarchs. Looks like they made their way up north a bit sooner this year.

MAR

Aparna and Vuday visit us for a few days. Joined them on the hot air balloon up the Teotihuacan Pyramids. Such a cool experience!
Back in Managua for a longish trip. Those wire pulls were painful but so much fun!

We took our R&amp;R in Maui for about a week. So much fun being in the water! But boy, oh so pricey! Haleakala was neat. Missed the whales though!

Hallucinations up on the Izta were surreal.
Family visited Cancun. We took a rain-check. Just didn&rsquo;t make financial sense.

The Nevado de toluca hike would probably be one of the highlights of our Mexico posting!

M took a salsa making class and she said she loved it!
A quick whirlwind trip to NJ, NY, MD for Rohita&rsquo;s wedding.

Managed to fit in a NextcloudPi migration and setup the Digital Frame.
