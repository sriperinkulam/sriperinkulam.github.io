JAN

Hiked up Izta via La Joya.
Quick work trip to Monterrey. Loved that those hills are right there in the city! Next time I&rsquo;m back here, I should plan to get here around a weekend. Food was great. Traffic was meh. Would strongly consider bidding for a position here - if/when one opens up!
M,S & S went to Oaxaca. They loved it!

FEB

Work travels took me to Merida and Managua. Managua had the vibes of any second tier southern Indian city.
Anton&rsquo;s Whiskey tasting was uber fun!
Girl scouts hike to Desierto Leones. Mike led the group. Was good to take a step back and be just a regular participant!
Piedra Herrada Monarch butterfly trip. Barely got to spot any Monarchs. Looks like they made their way up north a bit sooner this year.

MAR

Aparna and Vuday visit us for a few days. Joined them on the hot air balloon up the Teotihuacan Pyramids. Such a cool experience!
Back in Managua for a longish trip. Those wire pulls were painful but so much fun!
M & S went to Las Estacas for the Girl Scouts Camping trip. Missed being there with them.
We took our R&amp;R in Maui for about a week. So much fun being in the water! But boy, oh so pricey! Haleakala was neat. Missed the whales though!

APR

Hallucinations up on the Izta were surreal.
Family visited Cancun. We took a rain-check. Just didn&rsquo;t make financial sense.
Jothi patti and the Wierer&rsquo;s visited us for a week.
The Nevado de toluca hike would probably be one of the highlights of our Mexico posting!

MAY

Yet another epic Bourbon tasting evening.
M took a salsa making class and she said she loved it!
A quick whirlwind trip to NJ, NY, MD for Rohita&rsquo;s wedding.

Managed to fit in a NextcloudPi migration and setup the Digital Frame.

M,S and I went to a Blue Man Group performance.
Jinesh & Soony visit us in CDMX for a few days.
Tinkered a bit with Tasmota and HomeAssistant to setup a few smart-plugs.

Elizabeth visits for a week. Diwali!
M&amp;S visit Reino animal
We do a short road trip to Tula and Tepozotlan
