It’s been years that I’ve done something like this and though really short, it felt super energizing and relieving to see that I still thrive on such experiences. With clashing schedules and lots of uncertainties, Ankur and I booked our tickets on Thursday night. Mulki was kind of equidistant for both of us and he’s been wanting to try surfing for a while now. While he got his surfing classes in, I just rented a board and spent a good chunk of time in the water over multiple sessions. It’s been more than a decade that we met in person and this impromptu plan was a refreshing ‘stage’ for us to catch-up on several things while we weren’t in the water. Ankur and I chanced on each others blogs way back in 2010 and our shared love for the outdoors has led us on several running and hiking trips over the years.\nAnother highlight of this trip was to witness part of a Bhootada Kola - a devil worship performance which is apparently very common in the coastal towns of Karnataka. We were pretty zapped after the surfing session and couldn’t quite stay beyond 00:30 to witness this in full. Also, on the way to this temple we randomly chanced on some pretty cool bio-luminescence. Other folks in the group had been out on Saturday afternoon to witness a qualifying ‘race’ for the Kambala - a buffalo race event again popular in these coastal towns. Would have been terrific if we could have made it, but there was just not enough time to fit this all in!\nSuper sore from all the paddling, surfing and swimming.
