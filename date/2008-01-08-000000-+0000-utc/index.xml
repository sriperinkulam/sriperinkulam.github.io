      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 3 month Karate class is going to be held in campus starting Feb 1st.  Given my ambidextrous  flexibility and reflexive fists I would have made a wonderful karate kid ( ahem  ahem &amp;hellip; Professional :-) ). How I wish I could join it ! Had I not payed the 3 grand for my French classes I would have as well been into this. Anyways, gotta see if I can talk with the coach and join a month late. Amends can be made ! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just installed WIne on Ubuntu a few minutes back. Installed a couple of other windows based softwares too! Now they really work :-) . Haggard installations are now things of the past. Probably it&amp;rsquo;s time I move over to something more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
