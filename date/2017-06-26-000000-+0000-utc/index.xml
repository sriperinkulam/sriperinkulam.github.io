&lt;p&gt;Great day out with the kids. Hit Callahan State Park for a short hike. Getting them out of the house was probably the toughest part ! Today&amp;rsquo;s hike was also a test run before we take them on a longer hike next weekend. The 8 mile &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/01/21/middlesex-17-miler/&#34;&gt;Skyline trail&lt;/a&gt; at Middlesex fells should be a challenging hiking exposure for them. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Christmas, we got them all hydration bags as a suggestive nudge. They&amp;rsquo;ve been super excited to use those and this summer was a good time to get them rolling on the trails together. Only wish they lived closer to Boston. We&amp;rsquo;re lucky to have several splendid trails around here. Would have been a fabulous training ground for them&amp;hellip;Well, well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
