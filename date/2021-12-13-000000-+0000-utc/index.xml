      <description>&lt;p&gt;Epic moment of the day - Appa was finding it difficult to copy part of a text message on his phone. So I helped him select the content, copied the text and handed over the phone back to him asking him to paste it wherever he wanted to paste it. He looked at me extremely confused and said how could he if &lt;strong&gt;the text was on my finger&lt;/strong&gt;! Took me a good moment to realize what was going on in his mind and ultimately I did have to dispel his myth - text does not hop onto and off fingers when you copy paste. If only it did!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
