      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this week was spent planning the next few months and chalking out various things we had to line-up. We&amp;rsquo;re super excited that Shasta will soon be able to experience the cold a bit and that we&amp;rsquo;d be able to take her on some long outdoor hikes in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s turning one soon and we plan to keep her birthday celebration low-key. Probably a good breakfast out somewhere with the family. She&amp;rsquo;s now becoming super communicative - pointing with the forefinger if she needs something or wants to know what it is. At this point we&amp;rsquo;re convinced &amp;lsquo;Ka&amp;rsquo;s her first word. Probably inspired by the crows by the pool, which absolutely fascinate her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early next month, I am facilitating a visit of a group of about 50 kids to Kochi and Munnar. The activity line-up looks pretty cool and I am super excited to be back in the thick of it with a different pair of boots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Meena and I met a friend of mine from Infosys. We&amp;rsquo;d organized a ton of team-building activities together when we were on the same team. She was a fire-craker beaming with positivity when we worked together and one of the reasons I thoroughly enjoyed working in Infosys. Nothing much has changed since then! She was visiting her family in Chennai and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we were able to catch-up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were pretty much rained in through the week, (and S and I did get a bit lazy) so running did take a hit. Was a great swim weak though! ~30 min. swim sessions each on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and a 20k bike ride on the aerofit recumbent bike on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of other notable events this week - A first of a kind: Meena, S and I were interviewed on the same panel; Joined the Columbia Alumni folks here in Chennai for an early evening meet and a family friend who is currently preparing for his GMAT texted saying the resources I had pointed him to were super useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ramblr.com/&#34;&gt;Ramblr&lt;/a&gt;: Record, track and share outdoor activities&lt;/li&gt;
