      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive down to Florida was pretty uneventful. But for some holiday traffic near Virginia, we had a pretty smooth drive, clocking about 15 hours in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A random talk with a runner at the Baseline trail coaxed us to run a longer distance the next day. Got the four kids and Sharath onboard too. Well, the kids decided to sleep-in on Sunday, while Sharath and I head out to the trail. Realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t carry cash, so we decided to run unsupported. Running conditions were just right with a good blend of drizzle and rain. The beauty of winter is that you can cover so many more miles in the dark! Was mostly helping Sharath pace and finish within 3 hours. Wrapped up with 14.5 miles under his belt. Not a bad way to close out the year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week packed with hikes almost every day of the week and a lot of downtime with family. The girls convinced their moms to get extra ear piercings and Nikhil rode the wagon and got one for himself too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://convos.by/&#34;&gt;Convos&lt;/a&gt;: IRC based multi-user chat application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/2GhBPn&#34;&gt;Colleges are turning students’ phones into surveillance machines, tracking the locations of hundreds of thousands&lt;/a&gt;: Thank you, but no thank you! &amp;lsquo;Tracking you for your own good&amp;rsquo; - Isn&amp;rsquo;t that where it all starts going downhill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/gawvRZ&#34;&gt;20,000 ft under the sea&lt;/a&gt;: Mining, exploring and ofcourse polluting. We&amp;rsquo;re doing things with absolutely no concern for and awareness of the impacts on future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
