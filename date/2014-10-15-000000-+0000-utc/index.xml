      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/deep_cover-u2245.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/deep_cover-u2245.png&#34; alt=&#34;deep_cover-u2245&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;Early last month I happened to read a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ideas.ted.com/2014/06/25/science_of_freediving/&#34;&gt;TED article&lt;/a&gt; on the body&amp;rsquo;s reaction to water where the author talks about &amp;ldquo;Mammalian dive reflex&amp;rdquo; a phenomenon by which water triggers an immediate decrease in heart rate and optimizes respiration. The article instantly reminded me of scubadiving - something that I really missed doing this year and  introduced me to a discipline called freediving - something that sounded just as exciting if not more. It obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t need much convincing for me to procure the book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While describing his own experience learning to freedive,  James does a brilliant job by not just explaining the science behind freediving but also draws interesting parallels between the discipline as a sport and as a means to explore the underwaters. As he delves deeper, he outlines how freediving has two isolated yet binding groups - One that numbingly follows the discipline for recognition and breaking records ,  the other that uses it to research and reveal mysteries that humanity for long has never understood and the isolated few that blend both of these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how there&amp;rsquo;s so much you&amp;rsquo;ve not known about the waters and how much this book reveals - presumably still just scratching the surface. While I caught myself holding my breath every once in a while, this has been one brilliant read and I cannot wait to get back to the waters!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
