      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was stumped by this innocent letter from a kid in my class. Yukta - One of the smartest kids, questions me[ In RED and gives place for me to answer!] on how I came across the idea of playing the Age of Empires game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this game that we play in the class, she happens to be the &amp;lsquo;Queen&amp;rsquo; with the most notorious &amp;lsquo;subjects&amp;rsquo;. Guess she just wanted to vent all her frustration[?] through this letter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d asked the kids to find out why a zebra is black and white in colour. Ali - A kid who was in a marathi medium school until last year, comes up with this paper the next day. &amp;lsquo;Zebra mothe is black and waite. The zebra is black and wate. Jab upar wale ne usko aise kar diya, vo kya karega&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
