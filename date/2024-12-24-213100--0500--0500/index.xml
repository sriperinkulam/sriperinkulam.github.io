      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordered a Kobo Clara BW for M on a whim. Been a while that I&amp;rsquo;ve surprised her! Twelve years ago when I gifted her the Kindle she was initially super upset - we barely had any money then. This time around when she opened it, her reaction was neutral at best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Setting it up wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite intuitive. Took me 20 minutes to figure out that the software wasn&amp;rsquo;t showing the option for overdrive sync because it sensed our location to be outside US/Canada. An easy fix until we hit the next issue - M only has a Libby account and that does not map 1:1 to an Overdrive account. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll have to setup an overdrive account now, add all her library cards and then sync that account in the Kobo. Reasonable ask I guess. But doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help my case of getting her to try off mainstream devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
