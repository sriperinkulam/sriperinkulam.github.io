      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reorganized my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/07/migrating-over-to-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;Trilium Notes&lt;/a&gt; a bit. Over time I started dumping notes in there and somewhere it all went a bit wayward. I really need to start using it as a proper knowledge base. The good thing is &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; content that I refer to frequently is all in there. This along with my Signal &amp;lsquo;Note-to-self&amp;rsquo; are my go-to spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to read more blogs that are not tech related. Mostly driven by my curiosity in the tech space, I&amp;rsquo;ve somehow gotten into this bubble of tech-adjacent blogs. Would be nice to pop out a bit. Maybe I should explore &lt;a href=&#34;https://powrss.com/&#34;&gt;powRSS&lt;/a&gt; a bit? I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed I lean towards people who have their own personal domain. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of some sort of commitment towards actually owning their writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking if I want to get a nice digital sketch book. Or I should just re-purpose that old kindle? There are times I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to &amp;lsquo;write&amp;rsquo;. Some things are probably better just sketched out. I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.secuso.privacyfriendlysketching/&#34;&gt;Sketches&lt;/a&gt;
app before. Maybe i&amp;rsquo;ll just port that over to the kindle one of these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google seems to be making all moves to prevent sideloading apps in Android. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time I shift gears and look at other alternatives out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zen-browser.app/&#34;&gt;Zen browser&lt;/a&gt; looks real neat. Should give it a spin one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a mildly thawed frozen Papaya&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/29/all-over-the-place/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
