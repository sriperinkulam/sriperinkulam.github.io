      <description>&lt;p&gt;Known unknown issues! Got back to firing up a known instance after about a year. Had to spend sometime today trying to figure out why Known wasn&#39;t let me enable plugins that I fetched from Github. The folder unzipped as &#39;Twitter-master&#39; and only after some random shots in the dark, I figured the folder had to be renamed &#39;Twitter&#39; for it to work.  Oh, #Indieweb!
