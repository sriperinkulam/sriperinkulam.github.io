      <description>&lt;p&gt;The short rainy season is almost about to end here. There&amp;rsquo;s still no dearth of monsoon drama though. A warm and humid afternoon leads in to a breezy evening. In just a few moments, it feels like you&amp;rsquo;ve been transported to a coastal town. The surrounding hills lock in the clouds and the barometric pressure drops. Denser dark clouds churn their way up and magnificently roll up the hills only to be forced down. Small static crackles lead in to thunderous lightnings, all in a matter of few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocooned in a hammock, music by the side with this little one observing all the moves and doling out a cascade of chuckles from things related and not. Little joys.&lt;/p&gt;
