      <description>&lt;p&gt;I leave home by around 7am to work by bus everyday. It&amp;rsquo;s about an hours drive from my place and I tend to calculate how early or how late I am based on the relative presence or occurrence of other regular happenings around me. The bus gets to the outskirts by crossing a few posh areas in the city so it&amp;rsquo;s quite common to see International school buses drive past you. There&amp;rsquo;s this particular bus that I get to notice almost everyday about 100 yards from the Hitec city building. It&amp;rsquo;s not the bus that catches my attention. It&amp;rsquo;s a girl sitting by the third window in the bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first day I notice her she&amp;rsquo;s on a call with someone. The second day I see her, she&amp;rsquo;s still with that sleek jazzy cell phone. I unfortunately doze the next two days. Yesterday I managed to wake just in time and boy what do i see! She&amp;rsquo;s again busy talking with someone. Now, I really start wondering what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with her. All the Kids in the bus are hopping around. She&amp;rsquo;s the only female who&amp;rsquo;s dwelling in her own world. She&amp;rsquo;s probably just in her tenth. I&amp;rsquo;m least bothered whom she&amp;rsquo;s talking to but then something definitely seems to be out of place. Even before I get a good look at her, the bus zips across. Today morning I try staying awake just to have that quick look at her. This time it so happens that both our buses move in sync, I afford a quick turn to my left at the right moment and look ahead. It is then that something registers in my mind. Wait! Something is really wrong! I turn to my left again and observe a bit more keenly. Painting!!! That was a damn art work on the third window! 8O&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a girl after all. Just one wholesome, beautiful, artistic work of someone really skilled! I still have no clue why an International school bus should have an artwork of a girl, that too with a cellphone on just one of it&amp;rsquo;s windows. It did keep me smiling all day through though! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
