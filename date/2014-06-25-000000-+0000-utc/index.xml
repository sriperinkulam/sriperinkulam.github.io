&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleared the second Actuarial Exam today! Set the chopper as an incentive for me to pass some months back. Eventually grew out of it and was later gifted a fitbit by wifey. The chopper here was gifted by us to a roommate who&amp;rsquo;d cleared this exam earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this one exam took quite some effort to clear. Thrilled and am just not able to sleep. Here&amp;rsquo;s to the flight on a dark crystal night!&lt;/p&gt;
