      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating! A few GPS devices apparently had a mild(?) &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ff48e143fb7f0.93623598&#34;&gt;path offset issue&lt;/a&gt; few days ago:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The issue has to do with the ephemeris data file, also called the EPO file (Extended Prediction Orbit) or Connected Predictive Ephemeris (CPE). Or simply the satellite pre-cache file. That’s the file that’s delivered to your device on a frequent basis (usually every few days). This file is what makes your watch near-instantly find GPS satellites when you go outside. It’s basically a cheat-sheet of where the satellites are for the next few days, or up to a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this on my Forerunner 235 but I find it super intriguing to read about the &amp;lsquo;inner workings&amp;rsquo; of the background handshake. When I first got the Forerunner 235, I was amazed at how quickly it latched on to the satellites in contrast to the Forerunner 305 that I was actively using then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple decades ago when you bought a new &amp;lsquo;gadget&amp;rsquo;, you would get not only a &amp;lsquo;how-to&amp;rsquo; but also a technical sheet outlining the inner workings of the device. I miss seeing those sheets now!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I understood all of it, but this &lt;a href=&#34;https://invidious.snopyta.org/embed/zlm1aajH6gY&#34;&gt;video from Quanta Magazine&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best explanations I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far that attempts to connect prime numbers with the Reimann Hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
