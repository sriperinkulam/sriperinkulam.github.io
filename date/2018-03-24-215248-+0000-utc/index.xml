      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drove about 3 hours to visit the source of the #Nile. Decided to head to the &#39;Source of the Nile&#39; restaurant
on the west banks of the river instead of the more touristy &#39;Jinja&#39; side. I think it was a pretty good decision! Beautiful views from the hill and refreshingly windy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;70% of water apparently originates from Lake Victoria - Which in turn is fed by several streams from various regions nearby and 30% from springs or elsewhere&amp;hellip;Pretty surreal being there by the waters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive after Lugazi was pretty straight forward and actually more enjoyable than the section between #Kampala and Lugazi. Most of it was through the Mabira Forest which we went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2018/03/19/the-sky-captains-school/&#34;&gt;a few days back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow early AM, we head back to Boston. So glad we decided to &#39;close-out&#39; this #Uganda trip with the Nile visit!&lt;/p&gt;
