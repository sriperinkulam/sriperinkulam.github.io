      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a fucking miserable day today&amp;rsquo;s been. Came home this evening to the Main breaker panel being down again. Called FAC. While we were figuring out the issue with the power, we heard OP was electrocuted while playing in his yard and didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. Such a freaking tragic loss. How do you even come to terms with shit like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, little one. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember your glowing eyes and sheepish grin as you &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34;&gt;won me in your empire&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you delicately handling your food when you came over to our place for dinner that night when you folks moved in to our block. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you sitting by the side of the embassy pool slowly contemplating if you wanted to get in or not. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you and J introducing me to your bunnies and you running all over your yard behind them. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you and S running with those capes pretending to be superstars. And I so, so wish I got to know you more while you were around&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is so fucking fickle. Hug your dear ones&amp;rsquo; more than ever before. EVERY SINGLE DAY.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2026/01/15/op/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
