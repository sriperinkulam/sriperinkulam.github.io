      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meandering through &lt;a href=&#34;https://berthub.eu/index.html&#34;&gt;Bert&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s webpage and a few other sites - Such a treasure trove of information on the C-19 vaccine and biology/technology in general. No seriously, dive into these links for some great layman(ish) explanation of DNA, RNA, Vaccines and what not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3c8962f2a2.96282489&#34;&gt;Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea38322bb2a0.08041300&#34;&gt;No, Really, mRNA Vaccines Are Not Going To Affect Your DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3d3bb2ac73.65468826&#34;&gt;The story of mRNA: From a loose idea to a tool that may help curb Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3e5f534579.64795290&#34;&gt;I Made a Covid-19 Vaccine in my Kitchen and it Worked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: These links point to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;Wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d much prefer linking to the original article. However, I find this as a good way to save information which I can access later even if the original source vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christmas plan for this year was a major blooper. With the long weekend and everybody off work, we had initially planned to head down south to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covelong&#34;&gt;Covelong&lt;/a&gt;. The sisters and I would take on surfing classes while my in-laws and Shasta would have some down-time by the beach. We&amp;rsquo;d scoped out Sea la vie, as a decent place to stay during the three days there and confirmed they had sufficient C-19 measures in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on reaching there on the 25th Morning, we were appalled at the lack of basic containment measures. None of the guests and even more alarmingly - none of the staff were wearing masks or taking any preventive measures. We immediately cancelled our stay there and head over to Fishermans&amp;rsquo; cove to check if they&amp;rsquo;d have any rooms available - which they obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t! Got a few beverages, spent some time on the beach and head back home stopping over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://annalakshmichennai.com/&#34;&gt;Annalakshmi&lt;/a&gt; for a delectable and sumptuous lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
