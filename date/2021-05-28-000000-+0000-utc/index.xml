      <description>&lt;p&gt;It just struck me today how much I love writing crude, rewarding code. The type that is just sufficient to get the job done and that which &amp;lsquo;scratches your itch&amp;rsquo; and might probably be useful for someone else too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a software developer. Never been one. My day job is far, far from it. It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a decade that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in a software firm. And even when I did, a good bunch of my time then was spent of mainframe code [Rexx / JCL] and Change Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code that I write today is self-taught. Which is probably why it&amp;rsquo;s crude? But beautiful it is, because it challenges me to think of logic first and semantics next. It pushes me to find the quickest way possible because I know exactly what I want it to do. And most importantly it keeps my mind fired and active!&lt;/p&gt;
