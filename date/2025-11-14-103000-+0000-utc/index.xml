      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stopped by the Campost office earlier this Monday and bought a good ton of stamps. Added them to my digital &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp/#cameroon&#34;&gt;stamp collection&lt;/a&gt;. The Post office received a fresh coat of paint last month for the Presidential election. Staff were super welcoming and were super curious as to why we were purchasing that many stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s barely anybody I know that collects stamps still. Someday maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll mail these out to someone who&amp;rsquo;s genuinely interested.
