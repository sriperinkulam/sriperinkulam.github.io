      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stopped by the Campost office earlier this Monday and bought a good ton of stamps. Added them to my digital &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp/#cameroon&#34;&gt;stamp collection&lt;/a&gt;. The Post office received a fresh coat of paint last month for the Presidential election. Staff were super welcoming and were super curious as to why we were purchasing that many stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s barely anybody I know that collects stamps still. Someday maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll mail these out to someone who&amp;rsquo;s genuinely interested.

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does it feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing the same story multiple times over the last three days? Because, maybe I actually did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote something to that effect earlier today to one of the teams I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to resolve an ongoing issue with. They are a good bunch of folks. But there seems to be a disconnect somewhere that&amp;rsquo;s causing needless delays in what I&amp;rsquo;d like to get done. I feel issues fail to get resolved mostly because of lack of proper communication during their shift handovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes after I sent that note, somewhere it also hit me real hard. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really have sent that note? It does not benefit anybody but just my restless self. Adds nothing positive to the situation and if anything effectively brings the relationship a few steps backwards. Super frustrating when you see both sides of the coin and still need to get shit done&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/11/14/handover/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
