      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday little munchkin! At 00:00 on the 19th, Amma and I celebrated your birthday with just the three of us; with you fast asleep on amma&amp;rsquo;s shoulder, as we were waiting to board the flight to Hong Kong. This will be your longest [34hrs] birthday so far. We&amp;rsquo;re supremely thankful to have you with us and we&amp;rsquo;re beyond surprised how you make parenting feel so easy(mostly). As you grow in this mad, illogical, crazy yet mesmerizing world; we hope we&amp;rsquo;re able to will expose you to people, countries, realms, religions, experiences, wildlife, nature and above all nudge you towards making this a better place for everyone. As cliche as it sounds, time IS flying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re back in Baltimore just in time for the winter! Shuttled to DC for the IMST OA which fell through by just 0.25 points. Sucks, but I guess that&amp;rsquo;s part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a busy week. Didn&amp;rsquo;t get around reading/listening as much as I generally do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Memory Palace: Let it snow. On the flight headed towards Dulles today, I was pondering over the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/18/fresno-california-shooting-fatalities-reported-after-people-shot-at-backyard-party&#34;&gt;recent shooting&lt;/a&gt; in California. Shootings in schools and parties? Where are we really headed? Humanity is passing through some really shitty times and it&amp;rsquo;s beyond my comprehension why a human would willingly take another individual&amp;rsquo;s life. The U.S needs to control public access to firearms. Actually, No. It should prohibit individuals from bearing arms altogether! The absolute lack of any tangible action is deplorable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://grocy.info/&#34;&gt;Grocy&lt;/a&gt;: ERP beyond the fridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forecastadvisor.com/&#34;&gt;Forecast Advisor&lt;/a&gt;: 5-day weather forecast for a U.S. Zipcode with accuracy calcs for the major weather forecasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pixelfed.org/&#34;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt;: Ad and algorithm free, federated image sharing platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With the fabulous add-ons [&lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/instapaper-official/&#34;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/?src=search&#34;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/invidition&#34;&gt;Invidition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/&#34;&gt;FB Container&lt;/a&gt; etc.], Firefox makes more than a compelling case to switch.&lt;/li&gt;
