class=entry-hint-parent>Dynamics of the playground…</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Couple of hours back I opened my student tracker, just sat back and started mulling over how each of my kids have changed over the past few months. As I went through the list reading each of the kids names, images of the kid kept flashing in and out of my mind and most of them, so turned out to be of those moments when they were being ecstatic or really happy. This made me wonder how we as humans tend to capture/remember only the positives or the cheerful part in our relationships. But as a teacher, am I not failing my kids in not noticing their negative behaviour and working to get them back to their normal self? Am I doing justice to them by not stopping what I’m doing and not taking that extra time to pay attention to that minuscule behavioral change? How many times have I swept a behavioral change under the blanket and continued with my class/session? How many times have I ‘neglected’ a kid in the rush to finish off a topic/objective?

He just says – ‘One month’ and grins wildly! I wink back, pay for the tea and walk back towards the school gate. As we quickly make our way through the puddles and pits in the slight Pune drizzle, my mind wanders out in search of those small moments that I could call ‘achievements’ of the month thats been from my one month of teachers life. Sadly I get to recollect just a couple of them. And then it looms on me again how important it is to appreciate minuscule milestones in this journey – Something which I’ve been working hard on ever since the summer school.

The past four weeks have been really hectic juggling the plethora of tasks left on the table. The kids have slowly started getting back to the regular schedules and attendance is almost touching 100 percent.
The much needed break that I took hiking up the Himalayas and the internship at the TFI Summer institute gave a fresh perspective to the second academic year that I would be spending with the kids. Back in the holidays I was both optimistic and jittery about the maturity factor that I was expecting to see in the kids. Compared to last year they now seem to be much more on their toes and have got quite restless.It takes much more patience and effort to get their attention and even more a challenge to retain it. Wondering why, I could corner upon a couple of reasons - They’ve just not yet got out of their holiday mood, the afternoon summer camp is taxing them out or the more worrying concern - something is just not working in the classroom properly. The second year, at least the first quarter seems to be much more demanding in terms of investment and classroom management.

Today was the last day of the academic year for the kids. We got them to put up a small act as an End of Year showcase and invited their parents to come witness it. The idea was to get parents to be more invested in their kids education besides building the confidence of the kids. The kids were amazing on stage and put up a real pricey show!

It was all one peaceful ambiance with just minor disruptions here and there. To help manage the affairs, the architect of the land decided to pull up a few responsible men and women and give them the authority to administer sections of the land..Well, ‘Decentralization of power’ as they call it. And then, things changed. With just one word, rose eleven kingdoms all powerful and energetic. And within minutes, the Kings and Queens swore at the altar to uprise their just formed kingdoms. Ministers, Treasurers and Soldiers were deputed and responsibilities bestowed.

Couple of friends and I had been to the Korlai fort and were heading back from Alibag late in the evening. Seated in the rear of the bus, I’m not really sure how this conversation/debate ensued. For about an hour or so the six of us had a heated conversation on various policies, practices, ideologies and biases. Probably one of the best ever deliberations since my Infy days. In introspection, it kind of gave me some food for thought on how I’d like to proceed with the rest of my fellowship or for the next two years. Since I last wrote, things have quite changed in my classroom and otherwise. TFI has this concept of having two teachers in one class room if the number of students is more than 30. Kavitha, My co-teacher formally chipped in in July. With this things slowly seem to come under control. The kids receive more personal attention and we’re able to address issues in a much better fashion. Couple of kids who never even open their mouths are slowly opening up and and are showing interest in the classroom. The class dynamics has changed and kids are slowly learning to appreciate English. Community visits seem to make an impact.
