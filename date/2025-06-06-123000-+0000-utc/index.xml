      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bailing out to the new media - Will we though? In some form or fashion those that are leaving are probably just finding  a different medium where they&amp;rsquo;re able to connect better? I actually think there are more people blogging now than before. Just in different dispersed mediums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually if we do, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be just the ebbs and flows of a social framework? People come in, people leave. You make a connection here and a connection there and hope to linger in that ether of those network connections that&amp;rsquo;s always in a flux. Also isn&amp;rsquo;t blogging a sort of &amp;rsquo;new media&amp;rsquo; when compared to postcards or aerogram? When was the last time you sent or received one?&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/06/06/letting-go/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
