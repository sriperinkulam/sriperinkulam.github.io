      <description>&lt;p&gt;One year into Biking and today I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt the three gospels of riding at unearthly hours the hard way!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Carry a spare tube. PERIOD.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Never ride when you do not have the tools handy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Buy a Tube sealant and USE it!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I badly wanted to get myself a better helmet and decided to head to the Hypercity mall which supposedly stocked real cool biking stuff. Having got real good reviews, I decided to head to this place after the Walkathon meet yesterday. The store did have most of the stuff that you&amp;rsquo;d need but as luck would have it, they&amp;rsquo;d just exhausted their helmets stock! I did manage to talk one of the sales guy into looking for one in the stocks room but decided not to purchase it for want of a better one. Strayed round the place for sometime and finally picked up a tube sealant and a cool pair of gloves. Reached home at about 10:00pm and did some basic bike maintenance. The Sanghi ride was still ON despite none joining - I stay about 30kms away from the area where the real Biking &amp;lsquo;cult&amp;rsquo; stays!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;03:45hrs. I&amp;rsquo;m up and after a quick refresh hit the roads at about 04:10hrs. This was the first time I was heading on this road, this early in the morning. In about half an hour I reach the LB Nagar cross roads and all of a sudden the front tire gives in. That&amp;rsquo;s when I realise I wasn&amp;rsquo;t carrying the spare tube! Twenty minutes of some quick work [The &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/sriperinkulam/status/1819612659&#34;&gt;Thumbs-up bottle strategy&lt;/a&gt; really works!] and the flat gets mended, just that the plastic tire lever breaks. I decide to move on despite being about half an hour behind schedule. But even before I reach Panama godown I have another flat! And now, I do not even have a proper repair kit to set things right. Sigh! I&amp;rsquo;m compelled to head back home pushing [for the most part of it], riding, inflating the tires[Some real goodÂ  exercise for the hands!] and oh yeah dozing for half an hour on the roads! You never get these ricks when you desparately need them. Reach home at about 06:30pm and crash on the bed. One real bad way to start the day - lesson learnt though!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sanghi ride is still ON. But before that some serious tire maintenance to be done this week!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
