      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: For step-by-step instructions read &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/04/06/installing-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post instead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eyes on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zadam/trilium&#34;&gt;Trilium notes&lt;/a&gt; since last year. Having setup a robust docker framework &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/04/24/weeknote-17-covid19-webmentions-and-migrations/&#34;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to test Trilium out. Gave it a test run this morning and am way impressed with its&amp;rsquo; functionalities! With docker, installation was super easy and I am strongly leaning towards using Trilium as my primary note application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yml file to get this running on docker (swarm) is in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/sriperinkulam/60323d29922069887f627ccedc65bad3&#34;&gt;github gist&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;d obviously need to have docker installed, docker swarm running with the traefik container and the domain mapped as needed. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/04/19/self-hosting-jitsi-video-conferencing/&#34;&gt;Jitsi post&lt;/a&gt; has this outlined further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent a fair amount of time diving deep into the setup, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick first impression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beautiful interface that can be as sparse or as detailed as you&amp;rsquo;d like it to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypted by default and further protected sessions for sensitive notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A note-info section that details attributes and link-maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes can be &amp;lsquo;cloned&amp;rsquo; under multiple places in a tree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code scripting, tables, markdown, images, files - It&amp;rsquo;s got it all!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web clipper for quick screen and context grabs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export and Import functionalities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No mobile apps yet! However, it does have a mobile front-end which should be a good alternative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No multi-user support yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was exploring Joplin as an alternative initially but decided to stick with Trilium since the &lt;a href=&#34;https://joplinapp.org/&#34;&gt;Joplin app&lt;/a&gt; currently has limited functionality (Creating nested trees in the mobile app). Meena&amp;rsquo;s been looking at switching over from her current Evernote setup and I think this might be a terrific replacement for her. Was never really a fan of Evernote and that dislike strengthened further when I had to install the app either on a Mac or PC to export my content! I am so glad we have the strength of open-source to weigh against these silo&amp;rsquo;ist setups!&lt;/p&gt;
