      <description>&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding&#34;&gt;Linkding&lt;/a&gt; instance on the Moose for better managing my bookmarks. Not a huge fan of the name but it&amp;rsquo;s a great lightweight app doing just what it&amp;rsquo;s built for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Waboodoo/HTTP-Shortcuts&#34;&gt;HTTP Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; app on FDroid is a decent partner app to share bookmarks from the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Infyblogs and the internal BB were a great place to hang out! Over the last couple decades, haven&amp;rsquo;t quite  found a thriving network that is anywhere similar to those channels. Thinking of it, my foray into Linux was solely due to InfyLUG! Wonder if they still have those running!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After last weekends&amp;rsquo; hike, I threw my back out doing something super mundane. Had to take a day off work just to let it heal out. Tiny muscles I didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed were screaming out. If anything, it made me realise how incredibly complex our bodies are and a subtle reminder to strengthen the core.&lt;/p&gt;
