      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long drive after a long time followed by the laziest productive weekend so far. Early morning soccer talk walks, IKEA mending, pedicure with the family, new restaurant digs, some tech geeking and a lot of down time on the couch. Took the scenic driveway to Penn and 76N to cut into NJ instead of the regular 95N. Looking forward to getting back to building mileage for Wapack and Back this week!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;hristopher Knight was only 20 years old when he walked away from society, not to be seen again for more than a quarter of a century. He had been working for less than a year installing home and vehicle alarm systems near Boston, Massachusetts, when abruptly, without giving notice to his boss, he quit his job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;6 miles on the VFW loop. Good to be back on the roads. Never thought rest would be so painful. Should probably ease back in to the schedule and get some longer miles over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
