The park was very crowded and we had to rise up pretty early to have access to some quiet zones. Nevertheless, it was a just great being back there. Drove around the park loop, hiked up the bubbles, and visited Schoodic peninsula and Bar Island. Stayed at an RV camp park in Ellsworth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nothing to beat some good quality time with family, outdoors!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
