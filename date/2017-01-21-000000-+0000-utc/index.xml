      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good 5 hours out in the woods. Terribly underestimated the skyline trail. Quite a few foot slips and ankle twists made it more of a hike than a run. Also looks like my body is &amp;lsquo;reacting&amp;rsquo; to the weekday runs. Badly needed some tummilicious food at mile 13. Note to self for future runs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally got around visiting the Wrights tower! Despite visiting the fells several times over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve never really &amp;lsquo;made it&amp;rsquo; to this section of the trail. The tower by itself is nothing impressive but it does have some interesting history. Ice from here was apparently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2010/09/0913calcutta-ice-ship/&#34;&gt;exported to India&lt;/a&gt; way back in the 1800s when Middlesex fells was a commercial plot. The tower gets it&amp;rsquo;s name from Elizur Wright who was instrumental in converting the erstwhile commercial land to what is now called the Middlesex Fells reservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amazing view of the Boston Skyline from the tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First long run for the season. Hey, also my first self supported half this year. With tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s 9 miler, I&amp;rsquo;ll be signing off with about 49 miles this week. Not a bad start! Miss Me&amp;rsquo;s post run stretches have been quite instrumental in my injury free runs and I can&amp;rsquo;t thank her enough to keep pushing me for those runs after a long day. Only hope she doesn&amp;rsquo;t take her coach&amp;rsquo;s responsibility too seriously and cuts me off the fries!&lt;/p&gt;
