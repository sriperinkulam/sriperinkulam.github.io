      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks my last day as a Certifying officer with USAID. Quite typical with my previous career moves, there was a fair share of uncertainty when I signed up for this position. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very sure what exactly I was getting into and I guess that was likely the draw too. It&amp;rsquo;s been a terrific year and a half - Timing our relocation amidst the pandemic, Sifting between remote and on-premises, moving from the States and between the States, Balancing team and personality dynamics and over the last couple months - making the most of our time in Delhi. I&amp;rsquo;ll cherish my time here over the next several years and walk out having met and worked with some awesome colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I am pretty psyched on our next move. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming and would mark a good transition from being a generalist to a specialist. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the randomness, surprises and ofcourse a good bunch of travel to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
