      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few things that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://distanceathletics.com/trainer/david-bidler/&#34;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; offered us a complementary sign-in to his &lt;a href=&#34;https://breathetoperform.mykajabi.com/catchyourbreath&#34;&gt;Breathing Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Excited to get that rolling! He&amp;rsquo;s also released his first book - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thebreathetoperformprogram.com/&#34;&gt;Breathe to Perform&lt;/a&gt;. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get our hands on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been strongly considering moving over from WordPress to a static site generator. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using WordPress for 15 or so years now and have had absolutely no issues. The minimalism factor of static site generators makes it quite appealing though and then there&amp;rsquo;s that constant nudge to try something new. Will have to weight that against the migration work involved and take a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a 2TB Seagate drive and connected it to my &amp;lsquo;Mothership&amp;rsquo; laptop. I split it into two partitions - one acts as the secondary backup of the files I save on my RPi+WD1TB drive and the other for files I do not necessarily need on NC. While at it, I also setup an rsync pull from my Hetzner Cloud server to backup my docker volumes. Keeping the backups manual for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text-plain&#34; data-lang=&#34;text-plain&#34;&gt;sudo rsync -nchavzP --delete --stats user@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/path/to/docker/volumes/ 
&amp;#34;/media/Drive/partition2/Hetzner Backup/&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite a few interesting developments since I sent in a blurb to the TFI alumni group. I&amp;rsquo;ve expanded my &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/services/&#34;&gt;services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; a bit more now and I see it as a way of contributing to the educational ecosystem back in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meena suggested I build a bike for Shasta. I was initially looking at building a no-nonsense mobile platform - just a plank on three wheels and a pedal. While looking at options though, I chanced upon Infento. Looked very promising and loved the modular aspect of it. So we went ahead and ordered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.infento.com/product/explorer-kit/&#34;&gt;Infento Explorer kit&lt;/a&gt;. Should be delivered sometime today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is going through some real dark times now. We&amp;rsquo;ve not even come out of the pandemic (which we grossly mismanaged). It feels like we&amp;rsquo;re back to square one and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be like this! What is it that drives humans to these abysmal depths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currently Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten back to reading books! With so many things on the to-do list, reading in the past did take a back-seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The adventurer&amp;rsquo;s son - A memoir by Dial and Roman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wedge by Scott Carney&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Art of Invisibility by Kevin Mitnick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LikeWar – The Weaponization of Social Media by Emerson T. Brooking, P.W. Singer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Art of Thinking Clearly by Rolf Dobelli&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Here to Kill Everybody by Bruce Schneier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started listening to &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/book-review/the-wedge/&#34;&gt;Passenger List&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Atlantic Flight 702&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelorus_Jack&#34;&gt;Pelorus Jack&lt;/a&gt;: The dolphin that guided ships across the French canal. Also the first individual sea creature protected by law in any country!&lt;/p&gt;
