      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://micro.blog/Alligator&#34;&gt;@Alligator&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got most of my family off apple a few years ago.The ecosystem and apps are great but there&amp;rsquo;s so little room for fun tweaking. I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eyes on Dex and Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s convergence for a while too. For now though, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my modular workstation setup. Another stream of thought is to port the fam to a Snikket/XMPP/matrix ecosystem so we&amp;rsquo;re lesser dependent on external networks. That&amp;rsquo;s going to take a bit of planning and coaxing though untill the &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/bridges/&#34;&gt;matrix bridges&lt;/a&gt; are a bit more robust :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last month, I seem to have switched into a better reading rhythm. I&amp;rsquo;d probably attribute it to having a bit more time and mind-space for myself. Also, I figured I needed a better system to keep track of the books I had in queue.  While Wallabag has been a terrific tool to assimilate, read and archive articles that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across online; I badly needed one for books too. Last month, I set a bare-bones system in my note-taking tool and this seems to do the trick for now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a goal as such for this year. I do however want to get to these books that I have in my reading queue.&lt;/p&gt;
