      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, WordPress has been home to most of my digital presence. Sometime last week one of the plugins – Wordfence, I think – took a major dump and nuked my site down. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite see that coming but I take that as a sign for me to change things up a bit. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to test out WriteFreely for a while now and this might be just about the right opportunity. I&amp;rsquo;m not quite suew how I want to handle the migration. For now though, it&amp;rsquo;s a brand new shiny slate.&lt;/p&gt;
