      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more that I read and the more that I build, with every additional service that I self-host, I realize there are so many points of failure - each becoming more evident as time passes and experience grows. The blaring one&amp;rsquo;s get attended to sooner or later, and the not-so-urgent one&amp;rsquo;s remain there - slowly tended to on the whims and fancies of time and interest. Until, from a different perspective, what you judged to be urgent or frivolous flips and then you are just not sure what you are dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This must be why it&amp;rsquo;s so addictive. There are more questions than straightforward solutions. There&amp;rsquo;s so much uncertainty veiled with the promise of freedom, curiosity and learning. There&amp;rsquo;s the thrill in making things work despite it being a non-standard approach. And ultimately it&amp;rsquo;s all yours - the wins and the losses. Well, mostly the losses. But hey, even before you stop to assess, there&amp;rsquo;s something new round the corner that someone&amp;rsquo;s built - Intricate yet imperfect. Just what you need to spin-off in that direction…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This. is. why? What&amp;rsquo;s your reason?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
