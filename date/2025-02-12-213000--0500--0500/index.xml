      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got barely two weeks left here in CDMX! As with any move, we&amp;rsquo;ve been trimming our holdings down. Still amazed that I can fit almost all of my vital belongings into two 50 lbs suitcases. As a family our holdings weighed about 3000 lbs in total when we moved to Mexico city. Pretty sure we should be in that ball-park for this move too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made the tough call NOT to hike Orizaba the coming weekend. I think I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the mind space to plan it all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to let go of the 3D Printer I bought from a colleague last year. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time to tinker with it and it just sank in, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a tough time getting the supplies shipped over to Yaounde. Some indulgences - invested or not - are probably just worth letting go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweaked my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/05/implementing-static-comments/&#34;&gt;comments code&lt;/a&gt; to send notifications to my NTFY channel when this site receives spam - just for kicks. And boy, it does seem to work. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/12/time/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
