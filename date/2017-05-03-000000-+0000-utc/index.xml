      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally let go of the Cherokee today. Served the family well for close to 18 years. Our first ever car that we took care of and was immensely useful during our stay in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Down deep under I still know it&amp;rsquo;s got so much life and many more miles to go. Thatha took excellent care of it and we did all we could to maintain it. Hoping the new owner continues to do likewise!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet another person whom I know would be cross with us for letting go of this vehicle is Pappi. Our super awesome mechanic in NY. Going to be difficult to see him and break the news!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/IMG_4012.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_4012.jpeg&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
