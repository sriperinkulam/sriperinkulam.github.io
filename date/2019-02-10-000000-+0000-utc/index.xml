      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shasta&amp;rsquo;s first visit to Patapsco state park. Sharath, Meena, Shasta and I planned to head out together initially. Was pretty breezy and cold. Shasta initially was showing signs of queasiness, so Meena suggested Sharath and I head out while she&amp;rsquo;d stroll closer to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started out on the downhill and entered the woods around the corner. Meena joined with Shasta as we were heading back covering about three miles. A wonderful, refreshing day out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head out to Hot Pot later that evening. Delicious food and some real good time with the whole family!&lt;/p&gt;
