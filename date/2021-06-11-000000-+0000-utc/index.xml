      <description>&lt;p&gt;An odd and forced hiatus to the workout program that I had going with Meena. What started off as a discomfort in the tummy on Thursday afternoon led to mild fever and chills over the night. Likely the handful of saunf tipped me over? Took a few hours off from work and was back to normal this evening. Will get back to the regimen on Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
