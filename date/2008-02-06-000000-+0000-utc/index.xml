      <description>&lt;p&gt;A day to remember!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We officially launched the Hyderabad Adventure Group - Hydventura today in the Infy Campus :) . This is something that was &amp;lsquo;In the pipeline&amp;rsquo; ;) for quite some time and now after some dilly dallying the group is finally out! We&amp;rsquo;re 70 + now and will soon have our first outing sometime Feb-end or early march. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to expand once we get a foothold in organising outdoor events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities not constrained to Trekking, outdoor survival, Biking, site explorations, Rafting , Rock climbing, Para-sailing would soon be planned. Hydventura would try to do it&amp;rsquo;s little bit in bringing out the importance of outdoor recreational activities and at the same time spread awareness in the public the necessity to keep a check on exploitation of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: Hydventura is a club started by a group of Infoscions in their own interest. The company is no way related to the activities here-in and all activities would more or less be Dutch outings!&lt;/p&gt;
