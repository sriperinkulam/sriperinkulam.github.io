      <description>&lt;p&gt;I happened to sign in to  my yahoo photos for no apparent reason today and this is what  caught my attention&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo Photos is Closing down by September 20th 2007 &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; To be frank I was shell shocked! It was just out of the blue that I&amp;rsquo;d signed in and they would have deleted all of my photos had I not dropped in by September 20th. They could at least have sent me a mail regarding their change in stand! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, they&amp;rsquo;re giving you three options. One to directly transfer all of your photos to Flickr (Yahoo acquired Flickr in 2005 ) or a few other sites like kodak , butterfly et al , the second to download all the photos one by one yourself  and the third and most interesting- forego them ! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; I have about a thousand photos in it and downloading all of them is  way impractical. I was always considering transferring all of my photos to Picasa. But then Yahoo Photos never had an option for direct transfer. So I&amp;rsquo;m sort of obliged to transfer my photos to Flickr, which I reluctantly have accepted to!   :-(&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
