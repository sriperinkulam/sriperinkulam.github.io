      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so glad I moved out of the Apple ecosystem a few years back. Was good while I was using it and now that I&amp;rsquo;m off, I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow or have the urge to upgrade to the next in-thing. It is liberating and I guess - to each his own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely love such &amp;lsquo;meandering&amp;rsquo; posts! You never know what you&amp;rsquo;re going to be reading in the next para and the heading can only do justice to a specific section.&lt;/p&gt;
