      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first off the system post from a friends machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dear system buckled down totally today and looking at the symptoms there&amp;rsquo;s every reason for me to believe it has breathed it&amp;rsquo;s last! :-( The final moments it did throb to the core and when it missed the beat hell went loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments before entering the comatose state, it showed sporadic electrical activity. Dementia soon crept in and repetitive resuscitation techniques ;-) too failed. The arterial links on the MB paved way soon failing to identify not alone the HDD but also other vital devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aged 9 when she passed out and survived by none technically, She&amp;rsquo;s been a wonderful piece of assembly by the years. A brief look up into her distant progenies reveals a number of branched out prospective replacements. Though due consideration is being given to the suitable replacement, it goes without saying, the memories that she leaves behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May her soul rest in peace! Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
