      <description>&lt;p&gt;This labor day weekend, the fam VRBOd a pretty nice woodsy property in the Poconos. It&amp;rsquo;s been years since some of us have met! The adults had some great time together just winding down while the kids literally brought the place down. The property had direct access to the Beltzville lake and almost everyone took to the water. A first of kinds&amp;hellip;The kayaks weren&amp;rsquo;t the best maintained and a couple of us did take some falls in the water. Life jackets came in super handy! So thankful I learnt swimming early on. This weekend did bring out the outdoorsy flair from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
