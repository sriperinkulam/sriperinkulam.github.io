      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t figured where/when we want to retire yet, but sadly the U.S. seems to be a bleaker option with every passing day. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any country has really figured out their healthcare system well and those that had a decent stab at it seem to be hell bent on breaking it. For now, thankfully our Foreign service benefit plan does an okay job and we&amp;rsquo;re at an okay premium-benefit ratio. Only a question of time before that buckles though. As a former actuary, I do subscribe to the concept of having good insurance. However, the good ones are so few and stretched so thin. I keep telling my wife if we want to stay in the U.S. I should get back to teaching - Not just because I love it, but because it might also keep our premiums low in retirement. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/12/03/insurance/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
