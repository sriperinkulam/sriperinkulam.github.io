&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A terrific day outing to Las Estacas. Reminded me of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2018/02/19/no-morning-blues/&#34;&gt;Silver Springs&lt;/a&gt; visit in FL about five years ago. S kept mentioning this has been the best outing ever! She surprised us with wanting to jump off a 10ft high swing into the spring. I was hesitant at first - But boy I am so glad we did it! She didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go back for seconds but she absolutely loved the jump. A good deal of swimming, catching floating leaves and just wading around. Swimming upstream was a real fight!&lt;/p&gt;
