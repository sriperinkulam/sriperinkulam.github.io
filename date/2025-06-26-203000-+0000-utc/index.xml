      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got an official notification confirming that I was tenured a
month ago. Yay! Pleasantly surprised. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mean much, I guess, under the current administration. The recent RIF plans don&amp;rsquo;t quite bode well for domestic folks and rumor is that overseas positions are up next. Should have more clarity over the next few days. All I need though is just a few more weeks to clock in those three years and get the whole benefit of the TSP.
