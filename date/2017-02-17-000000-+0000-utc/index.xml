      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does Harvard&amp;rsquo;s largest course, an Introduction to Computer Science, use GitHub to achieve its learning goals?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Malaria doesn&amp;rsquo;t just make people sick. It also makes them more attractive to malaria-carrying mosquitoes, encouraging these insects to feast, pick up the disease, and pass it on to another human. But these dirty tricks might not just be another reason to hate both mosquitoes and malaria—understanding how they work together may lead to new ways to fight the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another 6miles in the evening followed by a two and a half hour Shiatsu massage with Miss Me. The massage was probably more demanding than the run. Some exceptional stretches though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I&amp;rsquo;m realizing how important and relaxing these stretches could be. I believe they&amp;rsquo;ve also been heavily responsible for my injury free runs so far. Besides the niggling shin pain now and then, I feel pretty good overall after the runs. The minor pain right above the right knee seems to have slowly crept away. I do believe I need to work on some more strengthening exercises to &amp;lsquo;oil my machine&amp;rsquo;. Shall hopefully incorporate them soon into the regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
