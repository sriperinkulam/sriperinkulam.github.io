      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, Installed Gutsy on my system today! :-)After failed attempts to install it last weekend, I was a bit apprehensive this time. But today, two minutes into the install I realized where I was faltering. I&amp;rsquo;d created four partitions on my Hard disk of 30 Gigs each for Windows. Fiesty was running on the remaining 40Gigs. Last week during the installation I&amp;rsquo;d configured the setup to create a Primary ext3 partition instead of making it a logical one.That was what was leading the setup to freeze! Surprisingly I was never warned during the initial stages. Anyways, I fortunately happened to notice the goof up this time and then the rest of the Installation was a breeze! Flat 10 minutes and I had Gutsy live and kicking! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I&amp;rsquo;d looked for after logging in was to check out the classy desktop effects that Gutsy comes bundled with. But to my dismay the OS threw up messages telling me Advanced Desktop effects could not be configured. It didn&amp;rsquo;t even specify the cause. A bit of Googling brought out the hidden mite - My Hardware settings were blacklisted since it couldn&amp;rsquo;t support both video rendering and classy desktop effects at the same time. But then I just wanted to find a workaround to get things working. Finally I happened to find one in the Ubuntu Forums itself. All I had to do was to deactivate the Hardware config. check that Compiz by default does when initiated. This could be done by running the following command in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mkdir -p ~/.config/compiz/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo SKIP_CHECKS=yes &amp;raquo; ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that roadblock had been dealt with I only had to install the Gnome Compiz manager through the Synaptic package manager. Synaptic installs are cakewalks. All relevant dependencies get installed and broken installations are pretty rare. Installation of the Compiz manager led to the creation of a Preferences tab in the Advanced Desktop settings. This is where real FUN starts. A bit of tweaking and you have your desktop at your whims! I&amp;rsquo;ll probably let the pictures do the talking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Workaround explicitly mentions that crashes are prone to occur if both video and Advanced Desktop settings are run at the same time. So keep in mind to get back to the default settings when you plan to watch videos on your Gutsy.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;A pain but still worth it!&lt;/em&gt; :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more to explore ( or should i say exploit :-) ) . Will get back if I happen to find something interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ghai hamari mataa hai. Ghai shaakahaari jaanvar hai. Ghai ghaas-phoos khati hai. Ghai doodh deti hai. Ghai khali ya safed rang hoti hai&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember that wonderful essay I&amp;rsquo;d written as a test to gain admission to Sandeepam Vidhyalaya! I was reminded of this episode today during my French class session. We were asked to write a short composition using a couple of basic sentences on some famous personality and even before I could pool in the Je&amp;rsquo;s, Il&amp;rsquo;s, fait&amp;rsquo;s, suis et al, my thoughts started drifting back to that particular day 10 years back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bro and I were in Johnson Grammar High School, an ICSE board school till my fifth grade. It was a common belief that syllabus in Math was much better in SSC schools when compared to ICSE ones and since my bro was in his seventh by then, people in my family wanted him to shift over to the state syllabus By default I had to tag along as no one ever trusted me, thanks to my consistent flunking in quite a few papers. But for Math, English and Biology, I barely managed to pass other subjects. The moment I got to know I&amp;rsquo;d have to write an admission test to gain an entry into the school I was all tears! They wanted to test my hindi. Something that I was extremely bad at then :-) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom , Bro and I went over the Princi&amp;rsquo;s office. My cousin who was then studying in that school introduced us to her. Both of us were asked to go into separate rooms. I was given a paper and asked to write a composition on &amp;lsquo;Gomaatha-The cow&amp;rsquo;. This was one standard composition that I&amp;rsquo;d been learning by rote for quite sometime in JGHS. Nevertheless, my written hindi was pathetic! Real pathetic! Bharathi Miss , the then Vice Princi evaluated my sheets right in front of me. I still remember that &amp;lsquo;WTH!&amp;rsquo; reaction on her face when she was skimming through my composition. :-) . I was half expecting to get rejected and I wanted to in fact. The very thought of meeting new people, getting accustomed to a new environment and all that was no way close to appealing. All I wanted was to get back to the 5th bench of class VI-A the next day. But unfortunately Bharathi&amp;rsquo;s mind worked the other way round - &lt;em&gt;If my bro was intelligent , there&amp;rsquo;s a high probability that his sibling would do just the same with some help. How could SVHS afford to lose such brilliant students? They&amp;rsquo;re in!.&lt;/em&gt; She comes out and tells my mom that though my Hindi was real bad, I&amp;rsquo;d be given admission. My bro&amp;rsquo;s admission stays granted without any hitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the persistent guidance of my Hindi teacher Mrs Sahani, I got a decent command on the language . Things slowly changed for good and I surprisingly started performing well. All thanks to the Cow! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, I wonder how some incidents just get etched in your memory!!&lt;/p&gt;
