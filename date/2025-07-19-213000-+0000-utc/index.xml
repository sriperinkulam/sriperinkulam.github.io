      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d initially planned on visiting HongKong to celebrate Patti&amp;rsquo;s 80th and then head to India for a short trip for our R&amp;amp;R. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/04/stented/&#34;&gt;Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s heart decided nah-ah&lt;/a&gt; and we ended up in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/dubai&#34;&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/pune/&#34;&gt;Visiting Pune&lt;/a&gt; was most fulfilling. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ahmedabad&#34;&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/trivandrum&#34;&gt;Trivandrum&lt;/a&gt; to meet Raju Mama. Drive to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ernakulam&#34;&gt;Ernakulam&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/bangalore&#34;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; but the flying &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/madras&#34;&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; trip was one last minute surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&amp;rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a weird feeling. To not be presence-aware of someone 24x7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, S had either been with both M and I or just M when I travel for work. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to be with just S alone for a long stretch. Until last week. M&amp;amp;I thought it might be a good idea for her to travel with me from Dubai. It felt like she matured all of a sudden during Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s hospitalization. Maybe she sensed the stress all around her and adapted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As S traveled with me, zipping across 6 cities, I felt I was constantly on the hook. How much buffer time do I need to get her ready? Did she use the bathroom before we head out? Did I keep a spare set of clothes with me? Will I find the food that she might like in the new place? If not, did I have enough snack options for her? Do I need to get her clothes washed in this city or the next? Which PJ set would she like tonight? How do I coax her to sleep despite all the flux around her? What am I forgetting?&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to not do that, now that she isn&amp;rsquo;t with me, It feels odd. And then, when it actually dawns that M&amp;rsquo;s doing this more or less 24x7x365 - besides the gazillion other things she does; I think the least I can do is get involved a lot more.
