      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was supposed to run a 6 miler today. Long day at work. Asked Miss me to come over to the reservoir. Initial plan was to walk it out. The shin pain in the left foot has become a cause of concern. Decided to take it easy for the day and head home. Gave it a good ice treatment for about an hour or so. Probably need to follow up with some exercises to strengthen those muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disappointed that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t run. Nevertheless, the whole idea of this training is to understand my body better and there&amp;rsquo;s no point pushing when I know this is better from a long term perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
