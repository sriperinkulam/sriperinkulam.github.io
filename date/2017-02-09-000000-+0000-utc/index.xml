      <description>&lt;p&gt;8miles on the regular VFW route. Was actually up at around 4am. After a miserable run yesterday was in no mood to run. Studied for a few hours and got back to bed. Miss Me managed to get me out of bed and hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Snow storm was about to hit by 5am, but looks like it took a break on the way and hit Boston only around 7am. With the snow hitting the face from all angles, The last 3miles were painfully slow. Managed to be back home by 8:30am just before the storm got worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ended working from home, snowed in!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
