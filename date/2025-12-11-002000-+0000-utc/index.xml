      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those four words - &amp;lsquo;But it is mine&amp;rsquo;; Definitely makes it all worth it. I have a similar setup wherein I use a Hetzner VPS just to proxy in all traffic to my selfhosted stuff. Initially had wireguard running across my devices. Switched to tailscale for a bit more ease of management. Maybe every six months or so something breaks, but it is all manageable. Gets fixed if I really want to, else it stays by the wayside until it really needs to come back up. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/12/11/digital-house/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
