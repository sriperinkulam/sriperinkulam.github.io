      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure how I came across this, but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did bookmark it to watch-later. A beautiful film with terrific snow mountain videography and kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having Shasta probably makes me appreciate this a lot more. Meena and I started taking Shasta out on hikes since she was about 3 weeks old. We expose her to sharp tools and fire under close supervision. I still think there&amp;rsquo;s so much more we could do with her once we overcome our fear of exposing her to the elements. And this video was a much needed terrific reminder of how short we were falling on that metric!&lt;/p&gt;
