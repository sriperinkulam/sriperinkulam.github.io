Miss Me gifted me a months rock climbing pass for my birthday. Been at it for a few weeks now and we&amp;rsquo;re thoroughly loving it! Something that we&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;m psyched we got to start it on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try and make it to the gym almost every day. After a long day at work it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how just entering that space helps clear your mind altogether! An hour in and though you&amp;rsquo;re physically tired, you walk out with so much more energy. Goes without saying, it also aligns  with one of my resolutions this year to work on my upper body strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last birthday, we went for an &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2016/12/12/flying-31-with-the-reindeer/&#34;&gt;indoor diving class&lt;/a&gt;, six months later we &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/06/12/ashtanga/&#34;&gt;started ashtanga&lt;/a&gt; and now this! Loving the trend!&lt;/p&gt;
