      <description>&lt;p&gt;7:20 on my watch and I&amp;rsquo;m still at home. The bus halts at the stop at 7:24 , not a moment late. Sigh! This was one of those days when I wonder how the driver manages to be right on time everyday. Thanks to my fast paced walk, I almost made it to the crossroads. Had to run behind it for about half a kilometer.. but still Spiky made it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sweating and Panting, I occupy seat 24 and by sheer instinct open the window. The bus jerks along and a few minutes later it happens to take one of the flyovers. Still staring out of the window and worried about certification and all that crap I keep gaping in open space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in my thoughts. The Oxford International school bus seems to be moving at almost the same pace parallely and there&amp;rsquo;s this cute kid for some reason crying silently. For no apparent reason I get back to my senses and give her a fake smile. She manages to reciprocate that and even before I do anything else, her bus overtakes mine. She turns back and keeps looking at my bus wide mouthed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the next crossroads we happen to come face to face again and this time she takes the initiative of smiling and then waves her hand. I wave back in a kiddo fashion :-)Â  .This makes her more ecstatic. She beckons her friends and says something. All of them then turn towards me, then gape at each other and giggle like nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boy! Wish I could capture that Kodak moment.There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that we tend to forget in this mad race called life. We happen to miss out on those subtle nuances , things that could make a world of a difference to you and more so, people around you if experienced in the real spirit. But then who cares of nuances? Everyone&amp;rsquo;s behind making himself a part of the bigger picture. A picture called Success, Promotion, Recognition and oh yes! that mirage which they call LIFE. Pathetic!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ah! So what about my certification? It&amp;rsquo;s gone with the kid! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have you smiled today? ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
