      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s friday night and Magno has their regular DJ blasting music downstairs by the restaurant. My room is right above the restaurant and there&amp;rsquo;s zero sound proofing. I plug my earphones in and turn on the noise cancellation. Works just as it is supposed to.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long few days. I&amp;rsquo;ll maybe listen to a podcast and fall asleep. Maybe read some?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sifting through my blogroll I land on &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/68fe2d14911b63.94312147&#34;&gt;Every mother visits but mine&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://azan-n.com/library/&#34;&gt;Azan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pineappleexpressmusic.bandcamp.com/track/find-you&#34;&gt;Finding you&lt;/a&gt; starts playing from my playlist. And from nowhere all memories of amma flash in my mind. Tears well up my eyes. I hold them back and pause the music. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help though. The post and the music maybe triggered those emotions? Or was it me thinking about her earlier this week during Diwali? Memories flash forward and backward like an old photo reel. I read somewhere memories are fickle. Each time you recollect something, it&amp;rsquo;s a variant of the actual. Your mind alters the recall very so finely that over time, your recall and what actually happened are way different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want that to happen. Memories are all I have of her.  And I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have any pictures of just her and me. I want to remember things the way they were at that moment. This is probably why I write about these fleeting moments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your close ones pass away, you don&amp;rsquo;t really miss them that very moment. You miss them at random moments and it whacks you real hard every single time. You&amp;rsquo;d think over time it&amp;rsquo;ll pass. But it fucking never does. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/24/missing/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
