      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of our last week&amp;rsquo;s hike I sensed we were close to a small dam but we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to that point . Wanted to explore that section and also cover the Alberta road trail. Meena and I head out this afternoon with the kids. While the trail was beautiful and the kids did have a real good time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite feel great. With temps reaching 85+ and absolutely no breeze, I was so glad when we were done with the hike. Totally about 2.5 miles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[gallery size=&amp;ldquo;large&amp;rdquo; link=&amp;ldquo;none&amp;rdquo; ids=&amp;ldquo;8111,8112,8113,8114,8115,8116&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This section of the Thru trail also had quite a few options for kayaking and rock climbing. Will definitely get back here later to spend time near the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
