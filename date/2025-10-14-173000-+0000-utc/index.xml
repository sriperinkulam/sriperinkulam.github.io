      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks into the shutdown and neither party seems to be in a rush to sort this out. Thankfully we have decent savings. Also does help that the state department has always paid two weeks late. This paycheck should be about 70% my regular paycheck accounting for work done until Sep 30th. There&amp;rsquo;s talk of this shutdown maybe making it to Thanksgiving. Historically, they&amp;rsquo;ve responded when ATC / TSA folks threw in their towels&amp;hellip;This time around might be different though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M wants to go to London with S. Thinking we should be able to absorb that cost. And then there&amp;rsquo;s the Virginia trip. Might be a pricey end of the year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the work front, looks like that Malabo trip is gonna happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon had its elections last sunday and Issa Tchiroma unilaterally declared victory today. Something that the Constitutional Council said would be considered &amp;lsquo;High treason&amp;rsquo;. They made it so far with very little unrest. Next few weeks though portends to be interesting! The worlds&amp;rsquo; oldest and longest serving president might not be all so benevolent after all.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/14/travel-and-drama/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
