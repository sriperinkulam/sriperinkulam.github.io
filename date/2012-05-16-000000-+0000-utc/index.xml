      <description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in my third grade, My brother and I tried learning to ride the BIG bike that one of our cousins had. Afraid that I&amp;rsquo;d damage the cycle, I was allowed to ride it only under &amp;lsquo;parental supervision&amp;rsquo;. One fateful day my bro forgets locking the bike and leaves for school. I seem to stay back at home for some reason and sometime around 3:00pm in the evening manage to escape out of the house when every one was having their siesta. I stealthily sneak the bike out of the garage and pedal off to glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when I realize it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back home fearing my bro would be back anytime now, as I take a turn round the corner and as luck would have it, I see him just ahead of me. I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand why I&amp;rsquo;d foolishly drove in his direction; Instead of turning around and getting back later. A different case all together If I rode discreetly! But the moron in me got anxious and I zoomed past him. A few yards ahead, there was another street cutting across perpendicularly. I suddenly lost all my balance and wham I fell into the gutter! What followed better goes well unwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling is a passion that I&amp;rsquo;ve developed of late. Guess it&amp;rsquo;s majorly got to do with substituting my craze for trekking. The Pune DC has a very active cycling club called Thunderbolts. Being a passive member of the club when I was there, the transition from trekking to Cycling made literal sense. I bought myself a cool 21 geared bike for about 7 grand sometime last month. Though I&amp;rsquo;m yet to fully realize its potential It&amp;rsquo;s truly been a machine that I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all started when I realized, I was not a normal human . And this was when people started commenting on my walking pace and talking pace. I never spoke slowly and never walked slowly. Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve controlled my talking pace but when it came to physical mobility; it&amp;rsquo;s only increased over time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Bangalore, sometime during the end of July 2007, I was sifting through a few internal pages in my company&amp;rsquo;s intranet portal and happened to come across this site that claimed to be a web portal of an adventure group. I registered just for the heck of it in their google groups. Every other week I ended getting a mailer from the group informing about one trek or the other. But then, I never cared. My friends circle was least interested in any outdoor activity. It was just Volleyball, Basketball, TT and Swimming. So be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months later, soon after I headed back to Hyderabad over just another lousy week; I happened to read a mail from the AdVentura team. It was about a Parasailing event that was being organized in Hoskote. Impulsively, I gave Suma a call and got myself registered. Given the short time span, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t arrange for tickets to Bangalore. As a last resort I went down to the Bus terminus and by sheer luck managed to get a ticket in the APSRTC inter-state transport bus. That weekend changed my perspective towards life. Up there in the air about 450m high, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d live like I&amp;rsquo;ve never lived before. Back on the ground, I promised Suma that I’d help her start a club in Hyderabad. Finally on 6th Feb 2008, Hyderabad had its own Adventure club - HydVentura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 27th March 2007, when I was transferred to Pune. I was on cloud nine. Pune as I knew it then, was a magnificient, young city. Little did I know what was in store for me . Just a week there and I managed to be an integral part of Deccan Highlander - The unofficial Infy Pune Trekking club. Almost every other weekend we&amp;rsquo;ve been on treks. The count never mattered. The count could be four, or it could be forty. All that mattered was we stood to the promise of having at least one trek per week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Staying in Hyderabad and not running is a gory crime! I&amp;rsquo;ve been a virtual member of the Hyd Runners club for quite sometime now and have finally shred the veil.Though I rarely get to join them, I train alone running on the streets and roads early in the morning or late in the evening.Eventually, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised running is such a wonderful means of getting to know your locality!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Formulated in Nov-2011, the Ratna-Malathi Scholarship is an endeavour to streamline and acknowledge the diligent efforts taken by teachers to incorporate sports, arts and intuitive projects into their curriculum. Through a structured framework this scholarship would provide a robust pathway for classrooms to experiment new practices, develop systemic modules and eventually help progress towards planning and executing a holistic curriculum. The student nominees of this scholarship would be required to participate in a state level talent recognition event which would involve a sports championship, an art challenge and a creativity quest. The scholarship entails a year long, fully aided sports or arts workshop of the finalists choice besides a three-fourth fee waiver for the next academic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envisioned by Srikanth Perinkuiam and Kavitha BS, this scholarship is a fallout of two years of their experience teaching in a low income private school in Pune. Witness to the impact that sports and arts could bring in to todays&amp;rsquo; mainstream education, this is an effort to replicate their learnings across classrooms. Since this is just the first year of its incorporation, the scholarship is currently applicable only to Grade2 and Grade3 classrooms in Pune. This was decided primarily on the fact that these grades currently do not have any scholarship schemes or pathways to opportunities. By providing participating classrooms a platform to share and learn from each others best practices, they hope one day all classrooms provide equal opportunities for every kid to excel in what s/he is truly passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
