      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just about winding down from the long weekend. Last week at work was super productive but also left me pretty drained by Friday. Working in a smaller shop comes with its perks but also brings in all the logistic hurdles. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing most of it is also got to do with us being in Africa. Travel logistics are a pain and the amount of admin overhead for getting actual stuff done is beyond bonkers. Decision memos, note-verbale&amp;rsquo;s, single entry visas, travel ticketing - always something that needs to be followed up on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family back in the states decided to rent a cabin in the Catskills and get some downtime. With photos coming in all weekend, definitely missed being there. Last time we did this in &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/09/04/poconos-fam/&#34;&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, it was a 50 odd group and we had such a good time overall. One of those moments when you feel this is the &lt;em&gt;tax&lt;/em&gt; you end up paying for choosing this career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exited a couple family WA groups that I&amp;rsquo;d joined in June/July to manage the air-ambulance for mummyjaan. Getting people off this wretched network is such a pain. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find a decent interim - use it where absolutely necessary and GTFO as soon as the work is done. Feels like I&amp;rsquo;m beating the same drum to a deaf audience but I will &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/01/16/lifting-the-veil/&#34;&gt;stand my ground&lt;/a&gt; on this shit. Currently I have the app installed in my &amp;lsquo;work profile&amp;rsquo; on my personal phone and turn it on only when really necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made some decent decisions on the financial front. With some liquidity, I think we now have a game-plan for some investments. Playing the long-game does seem to be making returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took some time this weekend to upgrade my Trilium instance to the &amp;lsquo;Next&amp;rsquo; version. Upgrade was painless. Major kudos to the new bunch of folks maintaining this real neat notes software. I do need to update a bunch of my notes here. Always an ongoing process!
