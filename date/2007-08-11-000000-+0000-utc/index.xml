      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about 7:00 pm now on a saturday evening. Got to submit a demo project which carries a bulk of my grading weightage. Sitting right here for the past 10 hrs. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of coding still left to be done and here I am sulking to the lowest possible position on my seat and banging the keyboard typing this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find that silly dumb bug that I&amp;rsquo;ve incorporated in my code unknowingly, for the past three hours and still I see no light anywhere. Everything seems perfect, but still things don&amp;rsquo;t work the way I want them to work! The Pointer gets referenced haphazardly, the loop jerks out in a wierd fashion, the output screen beeps but still does nothing much such that I can claim to have surpassed an error. Logical errors&amp;hellip;Link errors &amp;hellip;Grrr!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish things were better! :(&lt;/p&gt;
