      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_37938&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;1200&amp;rdquo;]&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/DSC02891-1200x900.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA; Sinhagad at a distance. This picture is from on of my previous hikes.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sharp at 0600 as we finally reach the road that winds up to Sinhagad, Ankur and I take a moment to savor the twilight chill. The last 7.5 hours has been nothing short of mesmerizing and rewarding. Just as it was twelve years ago when I did this hike with a much larger group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of me wanted to just camp right on the first hill. To think of it, this has been something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do for a while. Next time around, I should probably start a bit early and set camp on the hill just before Sinhagad so I can catch sunrise there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, something which had been up in the air for more than a year and half, finally fell in place. So this hike is also a celebration of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
