      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite a &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;, but was some good time outdoors. Last night M suggested I head out for a run the next day since the weather has been really good - overcast and quite breezy. This morning though, the sky was super clear and it felt relatively hotter than usual. Decided to still head out and so glad I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides taking all the &amp;lsquo;offshoot&amp;rsquo; roads, I also ended up doing the whole loop. On the way downhill, besides a few stares here and there, it did feel decently safe. I did consciously get my earphones off though- just to be extra aware of my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feels good to be back on the roads after a couple months. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/31/febe-loop/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
