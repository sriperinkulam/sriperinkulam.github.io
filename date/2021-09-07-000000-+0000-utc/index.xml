      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I was able to take some time to explore a few self-hostable options. I got to explore &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/28/caddy-through-the-tunnel/&#34;&gt;caddy&lt;/a&gt; (Which is terrific by the way!), setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/15/guacamole-clientless-remote-desktop-access/&#34;&gt;guacamole&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m also absolutely loving &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/28/july-27-2021-2105/&#34;&gt;Navidrome&lt;/a&gt;. I got rid of OSMC since we weren&amp;rsquo;t quite using it as much and setup pi-hole to block ads network wide. With these changes, I think I am able to put these devices to real good use. While at it, I also setup a WireGuard tunnel from a VPS to access my local devices securely outside my home network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/02/05/state-of-the-networks-feb-2021/&#34;&gt;February update&lt;/a&gt;, I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed the services on the cloud much. I did get rid of Bookstack, Known and Signal-CLI since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using them as much. I am however using &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/?s=trilium&#34;&gt;Trilium notes&lt;/a&gt; exhaustively as my go-to notes and knowledge-base application.&lt;/p&gt;
