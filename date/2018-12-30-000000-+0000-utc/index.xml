      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had my eyes on this trial ever since I saw the &amp;lsquo;Gun powder falls state park&amp;rsquo; sign on I95. Drove over for about 30mins with Sharath to get here this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty surprised not to find many folks on this trail. The weather was just right and this short 5 mile round trip hike was precisely what we needed to close out 2018. The short stream crossing at the end of the trail was an added bonus!&lt;/p&gt;
