      <description>&lt;p&gt;And just like that three-quarters of 2025 is in the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon is gearing for its Presidential elections. They go to polls on October 12th and it&amp;rsquo;s almost given that Paul Biya, who&amp;rsquo;s been in power since 1982, will be elected as the next president. He&amp;rsquo;s rocking it at 92 years. Of the 30 million populace only about 8 million are eligible to vote (20 years and older). Historically, these elections have been mired with civil unrest&amp;rsquo;s and protests. The next few weeks will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tomorrow night, if the Congress fails to  reach an agreement, we&amp;rsquo;re potentially looking at a shutdown. Beyond ridiculous that we seem to be at this juncture so frequently and living on continuing resolutions. This time around possibility of furloughs and RIFs [Reduction in Force] are highly likely. And then there&amp;rsquo;s also the drama that comes with it&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M most likely received her LNA invite. Yay! Looks like a training in December is a serious possibility. But again it&amp;rsquo;s never a given until she gets there and completes it. Adds a wrench to our planned December R&amp;amp;R and then a bigger wrench to how we handle bidding. 2026 is going to be beyond interesting. Choices, options, decisions and happy problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/29/themocracy/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
