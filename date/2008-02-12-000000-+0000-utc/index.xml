      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 1.5 hr travel back home in the traffic is taking its toll. It was fine for the first one month, but of late I&amp;rsquo;ve realized there&amp;rsquo;s nothing much productive that I&amp;rsquo;m able to do once I&amp;rsquo;m back and whatever little I can force myself to, isn&amp;rsquo;t really helping me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month seems to be a bit demanding. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to pick up on .Net , complete an internal certification and oh yes, there&amp;rsquo;s the french certification exam too. Besides, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to avoid sacrificing  my personal time come what may. After all , that&amp;rsquo;s one thing that keeps me motivated :-) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From yesterday, I&amp;rsquo;ve started tuning my body clock.  I get back home by around 9:00 pm , have my dinner by 9:30pm and hit the bed by 10:30.  Morning by around 3:30am I&amp;rsquo;m all fresh to get up and get things started. And thanks to my motion sensitive grey cells :-) I also get to have a 1hr catnap :-) on the way to office! With no much disturbances that early, my work gets done quickly. Things are working just great and hope it continues :-) .&lt;/p&gt;
