      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week in Malabo, I discovered that none of my self-hosted services were working. Initially, I thought it was due to my home internet connection. However, upon returning last night, I realized that wasnâ€™t the case at all. My tiny reverse proxy, Caddy, had encountered an issue during an automated security upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve adopted a hands-off approach to self-hosting, setting up auto-updates for all my services. I only intervene when something breaks. Today, I decided to give my setup a little TLC, upgrading my passthrough VPS and Odroid XU4 to Bookworm. Remarkably, the process took less than 30 minutes! Thanks to Docker and Tailscale, everything connects seamlessly and just works. Love it! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/caddy-not-caddying/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
