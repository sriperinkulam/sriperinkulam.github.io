      <description>&lt;p&gt;So beautifully phrased! Be it social gatherings, team meetings, interviews or even regular discussions; there&amp;rsquo;s so much &amp;rsquo;lost&amp;rsquo; in all forms of human communication!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What’s going on is that without some kind of direct experience to use as a touchstone, people don’t have the context that gives them a place in their minds to put the things you are telling them. The things you say often don’t stick, and the few things that do stick are often distorted. Also, most people aren’t very good at visualizing hypotheticals, at imagining what something they haven’t experienced might be like, or even what something they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; experienced might be like if it were somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description>
