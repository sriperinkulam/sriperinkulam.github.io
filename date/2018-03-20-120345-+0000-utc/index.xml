      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the drive back to #Kampala we were stuck in a traffic jam. A tempo wanting to cross over to the other side, decided to cut in from one of the feeder roads, essentially blocking the traffic on the opposite direction. Noticing this, the mini-van on the opposite side veered off the road and on to the sidewalk behind the tempo circumventing it and casually got back on the road. Other vehicles followed suite. I backed out a bit to let the tempo cross and he gleefully went his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely no horns or visual stress on any of the drivers! Can&#39;t imagine this happening in India. Absolutely love driving here!&lt;/p&gt;
