      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://withknown.com/&#34;&gt;WithKnown&lt;/a&gt; for about a minute several years ago. Loved the interface and software but it never really stood the test of time. Yesterday, while searching for older posts related to Uganda, I realized, I never quite moved those posts over. Spent about an hour yesterday and migrated those over to this portal. While at it, I also migrated my old twitter posts over. And with that I think all content is now present on this portal. Since the feed settings are limited to 10 most recent posts, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t spam the RSS feeds.
