      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meena&amp;rsquo;s been interested in building our family tree for a while now. Installed Gramps on her machine and she&amp;rsquo;s feeding this nifty application with all the family data. This is going to be an extended project and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what comes out of it. Haven&amp;rsquo;t researched much but looks like Gramps does not have a shared/collaborative edit features. It does have good export features, so should be easy to move data around to other applications if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
