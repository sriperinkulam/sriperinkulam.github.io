      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last two months there&amp;rsquo;s never been a day when I&amp;rsquo;ve woken before 6:00 am. I&amp;rsquo;ve broken that principle today :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, I had my first class in Guitar today! And lemme tell you, it was just great!Had a cup of coffee and left on my Harley Davidson to Melowings&amp;hellip;was right there at 7:00am . I was the only student there and the instructor began outright. No formalities, no courtesies.. down to the point!! He started off teaching me the basics of deciphering the notes , reading them , understanding them and finally translating them to your finger&amp;rsquo;s. I was like&amp;hellip;Man!! This easy huh!Why didn&amp;rsquo;t I learn it by myself?..Done with the explanations on the staff,the treble clef, the semi breve, the minim , the crotchet and the other basic lingua franca of instruments and the notes, he handed me over a Guitar and taught me how to hold it :-) Only while doing it practically did I understand how difficult things can be..Phew! I had to read the notes, understand them, translate them to my fingers and damn..do everything in synchronism!..and even before I started striking the first chord right..this guy tells me, I am not to look at the guitar while playing. Huh!..could things get any better??&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their tag line says&amp;hellip;Music improves concentration.I bet! I&amp;rsquo;m gonna beat Einstein by the time I learn playing a song on the instrument :-) All set and done , I just managed to finish playing the note he had provided me , just once with herculian difficulty, when a kid , probably of 8 yrs walks into the room, picks up his Guitar, places his notes on the table and starts playing elegantly . Here I am , trying to locate my fingers on the frets and this guy mockingly plays it wham wham with his fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey! Where&amp;rsquo;s all my concentration? Barely managed to finish just another chord when he throws a bomb shell on me&amp;hellip;Need any help? Boohoo.. I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt this bad even when i used to fail in my tests in my Fifth grade!! :-( Just said..Thanks! am fine and kept rattling the guitar. He then gives me a sarcastic smile and walks out!!! Where the heck in this Earth do I hide my face!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just hoping against hope he doesn&amp;rsquo;t come tomorrow. Anyways.. Calvin would be accompanying me &amp;hellip; Atleast senior to him by a day :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
