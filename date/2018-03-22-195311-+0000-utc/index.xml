      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visited the Wildlife Education center in Entebbe. Incredible experience!#Firsts - Petted a Cheetah on her terms in a controlled wild environment. Followed the guide into the enclosure (the size of a football field) locking the door behind us. He alerted the two cheetahs, calling their names and slowly moved towards them. The two hid amidst the bushes. We approached them cautiously from one end to another. Probably the size of a football field. One continued playing while the other stretched out and lounged on the grass. The guide first approached and petted her and we followed suit. A few minutes later the guide asked us to walk out slowly - us first and he right behind us. Still inside the enclosure for about five to ten minutes, the guide continued answering our questions. The cats were minding their own business least worried about our presence. Eventually got out of the enclosure.Never fathomed I&#39;d be this close to wild animals&amp;hellip;Insane experience. Subconsciously I did regulate my breathing with some deep breaths now and then&amp;hellip;Looking back, there was no plan B!#TIL Lions are the only cats that hunt in groups. The females hunt mostly for food. Males pitch in only when required and take care of the cubs when the females are out. Males get first dibs, followed by the cubs and only then the females get to eat. Alpha males become the leader of the pack. On some occasions, outcast lions tend to form a pack making them the strongest force in the forest. Quite similar to &#39;gangs&#39; on the street. While hunting the alpha picks one particular prey and the rest in the pack get the cue and help corner it down. Rest of the non-chosen one&#39;s are NOT attacked even if they&#39;re an easy target.Â #Firsts - Fed a Giraffe and learnt they&#39;re mostly silent! Their hearts are pretty big and weight about 10Kilos#Firsts - Met the insanely wise looking Shoebill! This one socializes by nodding its head downwards and &#39;clapping&#39; with its beak!#Firsts - Met about 20 chimps and realised how insanely similar they were to Humans. One little one was using a long twig to fetch bananas from the stream. Could easily pass off for a human kid.Â No kidding!#TIL about the Keystone Species! Reminded me about theÂ Alabama Sturgeon and the introduction of wolves to save an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
