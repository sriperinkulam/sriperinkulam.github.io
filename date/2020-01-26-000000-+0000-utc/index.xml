      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally got around installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://pixel.srkn.org/sriperinkulam&#34;&gt;PixelFed&lt;/a&gt; on a Hetzner server. Absolutely love it! It&amp;rsquo;s truly an Instagram clone sans the tracking. The lead developer has some interesting updates up his sleeve and I am very keen to see how this project shapes up as it evolves out of beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meena suggested Nik and I work on the 3D puzzle Nik&amp;rsquo;s had for quite sometime now. Worked on it till about 0200 the next day morning and finished setting up this beautiful musical box puzzle. The engineering could have been a bit more nuanced. However, had a terrific time working on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed to fit in a short 4.5mile hike along the Thru trail in Patapsco State Park. With dusk setting in and absolutely nobody else on the trail, it did feel a bit spooky being out there. Spotted a few Deers and a fox on the way back. The old Woodstock bar and the huge empty parking lot for the trail right beside the railway line was probably something that added to the eeriness of the evening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki_(2012_film)&#34;&gt;Kon-Tiki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lighthouse_of_the_Orcas&#34;&gt;The Lighthouse of the Orcas&lt;/a&gt;. Both terrific movies leaving you with the urge to do more meaningful things in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quanta &lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/YKCpZr&#34;&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; they&amp;rsquo;re launching a new podcast! Super excited to see how this shapes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
