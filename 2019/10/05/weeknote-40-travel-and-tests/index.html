Interesting podcasts this week:\nNow that I don’t have a commute to work, I had to find ways to incorporate listening to podcasts during the day.

Takes me about an hour to fix meals for the family and it’s quality time I could further enhance listening to some great channels.\nCame across The Memory Palace while listening to Radiolab. With terrific audio placement and Nate’s equally endearing story-telling, I sense this channel being my go-to in podcasts. Absolutely loved his piece on FDR and the USS Iowa. Meena introduced me to Nat-Geo’s Overheard. With whale songs and scuba diving in pyramids, this channel does sound pretty promising. Interesting reads this week:\nThe Independent posted an article on how, many large ships were fitted with scrubbers to release gases into the ocean waters to circumvent pollution laws. It is viscerally depressing how corporate firms diligent actions are driving us all down an abyss. Makes me question at times if individual pro-climate action still has any effect… Intrigued by the Memory palace podcast, some deeper reading on the USS Iowa - ‘Don’t shoot! We’re Republicans!’ The Climate change crisis migrants: The keys’ are sinking and we still don’t get it. Do we? The UK is getting rid of its ‘get-out after graduation’ approach. Brilliant move by Boris! The world and work dynamics have changed and it’s time countries and companies realize heavy measures need to be put in place to facilitate retaining top talent. It’s a clear win-win!
