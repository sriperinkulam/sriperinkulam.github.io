      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a failed attempt &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/daynote/2025-nov-11/#note-1&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I made it up to Mbankolo this morning. Romero joined me and we ran into an LGF at the base of the hill. This place is pretty neat and way better than Mt. Febe! So glad I decided to give this another shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, instead of coming via the market, we decided to climb up towards Mt. Febe and took the inner roads via the golf course. This could be a fun route to retrace on the reverse sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to figure out why my garmin isn&amp;rsquo;t recording the GPX properly. Oddly, Looks like all other metrics are logged correctly. The only thing I really changed was syncing it with GadgetBridge last week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a real good time at the Marine ball this year. This one felt way more &amp;lsquo;connected&amp;rsquo;. Probably because we knew almost everyone? Had to head back home around 2130 right around the time the music was kicking in. The souvenir &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/coin/#2025-msg-250th-marine-ball-coin&#34;&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt; looked pretty tame as compared to the coin the Yaoundé detachment designed earlier this year.

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does it feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing the same story multiple times over the last three days? Because, maybe I actually did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote something to that effect earlier today to one of the teams I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to resolve an ongoing issue with. They are a good bunch of folks. But there seems to be a disconnect somewhere that&amp;rsquo;s causing needless delays in what I&amp;rsquo;d like to get done. I feel issues fail to get resolved mostly because of lack of proper communication during their shift handovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes after I sent that note, somewhere it also hit me real hard. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really have sent that note? It does not benefit anybody but just my restless self. Adds nothing positive to the situation and if anything effectively brings the relationship a few steps backwards. Super frustrating when you see both sides of the coin and still need to get shit done&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/11/14/handover/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks into the shutdown and neither party seems to be in a rush to sort this out. Thankfully we have decent savings. Also does help that the state department has always paid two weeks late. This paycheck should be about 70% my regular paycheck accounting for work done until Sep 30th. There&amp;rsquo;s talk of this shutdown maybe making it to Thanksgiving. Historically, they&amp;rsquo;ve responded when ATC / TSA folks threw in their towels&amp;hellip;This time around might be different though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M wants to go to London with S. Thinking we should be able to absorb that cost. And then there&amp;rsquo;s the Virginia trip. Might be a pricey end of the year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the work front, looks like that Malabo trip is gonna happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon had its elections last sunday and Issa Tchiroma unilaterally declared victory today. Something that the Constitutional Council said would be considered &amp;lsquo;High treason&amp;rsquo;. They made it so far with very little unrest. Next few weeks though portends to be interesting! The worlds&amp;rsquo; oldest and longest serving president might not be all so benevolent after all.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/14/travel-and-drama/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between M&amp;amp;S taking ill earlier this week and the shutdown/furlough drama on Wednesday, last week whizzed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined the Poth&amp;rsquo;s for a game night on Friday. S and the kids watched &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; while we played a bunch of games. Building your empire, Skyjoy, Really bad art, and that one real interesting game which we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to play&amp;hellip;2100 and had to get S to bed to be ready for the Swim meet next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnected with D. Konduru after almost 6 years. Time files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com//2021/10/07/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt; popped in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; today. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember posting about this but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I saved it in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&amp;rsquo;s down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/&#34;&gt;almost 10 year old&lt;/a&gt; hard drive before it goes kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicale.org/v3.html&#34;&gt;Radicale&lt;/a&gt; instance in my homeserver and configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davx5.com/&#34;&gt;DAVx5&lt;/a&gt; on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Setup a <a href="https://radicale.org/v3.html">Radicale</a> instance in my homeserver and configured <a href="https://www.davx5.com/">DAVx5</a> on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&hellip;<a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/" style="text-decoration: none !important;">🔗</a>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switched off my phone from airplane mode first thing this morning to check on the &amp;lsquo;Shutdown&amp;rsquo; status and as expected congress did fail to secure those 60 votes. Also received a couple emails mentioning my position was &lt;em&gt;non-excepted&lt;/em&gt; and hence I was effectively furloughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Received another email around 2200 stating my position is now considered &lt;em&gt;excepted&lt;/em&gt; and I need to report back to work the next working day. Alrighty, we&amp;rsquo;re back in business. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/01/furloughed/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And just like that three-quarters of 2025 is in the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon is gearing for its Presidential elections. They go to polls on October 12th and it&amp;rsquo;s almost given that Paul Biya, who&amp;rsquo;s been in power since 1982, will be elected as the next president. He&amp;rsquo;s rocking it at 92 years. Of the 30 million populace only about 8 million are eligible to vote (20 years and older). Historically, these elections have been mired with civil unrest&amp;rsquo;s and protests. The next few weeks will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tomorrow night, if the Congress fails to  reach an agreement, we&amp;rsquo;re potentially looking at a shutdown. Beyond ridiculous that we seem to be at this juncture so frequently and living on continuing resolutions. This time around possibility of furloughs and RIFs [Reduction in Force] are highly likely. And then there&amp;rsquo;s also the drama that comes with it&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M most likely received her LNA invite. Yay! Looks like a training in December is a serious possibility. But again it&amp;rsquo;s never a given until she gets there and completes it. Adds a wrench to our planned December R&amp;amp;R and then a bigger wrench to how we handle bidding. 2026 is going to be beyond interesting. Choices, options, decisions and happy problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/29/themocracy/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

Baked my best ever whole-wheat vegan bread yet! This one was super straightforward and barely needed much pre-work. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/28/bread/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
