      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was supposed to be a &amp;lsquo;Bridged&amp;rsquo; holiday. In this part of the world, the president apparently declares certain days to be holidays if they happen to fall adjacent to a previously declared public holiday and the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tomorrow being Cameroon day, rumor was that today would be one of those bridged holidays. Sadly it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Locally employed staff were definitely not happy. The Ambo did declare a 59 minute early release. Got the message while we were amidst a small project and not quite at a good stopping point. So we chugged along and head home when we were done. Will take it in spirit though. Merci Beaucoup! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/19/unbridged/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/pinocchio.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

S wanted me to read Pinocchio out to her this afternoon. Later this night, right after she brushed her teeth, she innocently asked me if &amp;lsquo;wishing stars&amp;rsquo; were true. I of course, confirmed they did exist and that she had to patiently wait for the magic to come through. Now girl, not everything you read in books is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long she&amp;rsquo;ll actually believe these things but I do hope to keep this awesome concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/12/26/magic/&#34;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; alive in her as much as I can.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/04/pinocchio/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home for the next two years! We just got here last night. Arrivals at the airport was super chaos. We do know what not to do next time though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city per se feels like a tier two city in India. Looks like we came in just in time for the short-rainy season. Walk to work is literally two minutes! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/04/16/yaounde/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
