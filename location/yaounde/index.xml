      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/map&#34;&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; page to reflect posts that have a set location. Currently this is a super vanilla layout and I think I should cluster these by region. I do like how it&amp;rsquo;s turned out though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at it, I realised I missed downloading pictures from my old Flickr account to Nextcloud. Brought those in and nuked the Flickr account. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/03/maps/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last several days have been extremely trying on the family. Mummyjaan had a cardiac arrest on 27 June. She woke up that morning complaining of uneasiness and moving pain across her chest and back. We initially thought it was gas and I made my way to work, just as usual. S sent me an email at around 0800 mentioning the pain wasn&amp;rsquo;t subsiding and that we&amp;rsquo;d have to take her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health unit suggested we take her to the Central Hospital in Yaounde. Around 0815 she began sweating profusely and the pain only seemed to increase. Motorpool was called and we made it to the hospital in about 30 minutes. Took us about an hour to speak to the cardiologist and she confirmed it was an MI event. The hospital didn&amp;rsquo;t have a Cath lab so Thrombolysis was the next step to stabilise her. As luck would have it, the hospital did not have the block-buster drug needed to do the Thrombolysis. They mentioned the military hospital had it and the doctor was willing to come with us to get the drug. M went with the doctor since the doctor only spoke French, while we waited at the hospital. Once there,  M texted that she didn&amp;rsquo;t have the cash needed. 160k FCFA. Easy day. The hospital was generous enough to release the drug without initial payment. I head to the Military hospital to pay for the drug and the doctors in the Central Hospital started the treatment. Once I find the two nurses at the Military hospital, they walk me to the chief doctors&amp;rsquo; room that&amp;rsquo;s hidden all the way in one of the nooks of the hospital. Only there I realise, they wanted 1.6 Million FCFA and not 160k FCFA. That&amp;rsquo;s about 3000 USD and they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take credit card or USD either. I tell them I&amp;rsquo;ll have to get back with the funds and make my way out of the hospital. We barely had 500 USD equivalent FCFA in hand. The bank in the embassy was closed given it was a Friday. We reached out to as many people as we could and finally pooled enough money to cover the costs. M and I head back to the hospital handing over the wads of cash and hoping they stick to the deal. Probably the biggest sigh of relief I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a while walking away with that receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/CentralHospitalYND.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the hospital, the doctors mentioned the process was successful and she was recovering well. Not quite sure exactly when, but we glean from them that she did go into a cardiac shock after the drugs administration. Dobutamin was administered to support the heart. As we explore our next steps we realise we barely have any options left here in Cameroon. Family docs confirmed getting an Angio is the next course of action. There&amp;rsquo;s no cath lab nearby and we were nowhere confident about the post-op healthcare here. Meanwhile, over the weekend we have abysmally poor support or information from the nurses and doctors. They&amp;rsquo;re barely divulging any information and the ICU doctor apparently made the rounds but never spoke to us. We pull all possible strings we can. Jimmy Francis is able to get the President&amp;rsquo;s doctor visit the hospital and the embassy put some more pressure on the hospital to atleast give us as much information as they could. Things slowly improved a bit after this but we&amp;rsquo;re barely satisfied. The doctors seem to know their trade but there&amp;rsquo;s just so little infrastructure support. Their extremely slow pace of action and poor communication was beyond concerning. We decide to Medevac her as soon as we could mobilize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours of debating the pros and cons of medevacing her to Nairobi, Joberg, Morroco, Dubai and Chennai; we decided to get her to Dubai. It was monday evening already. The air ambulance needed 100% funds upfront and they also needed a confirmation letter from the receiving hospital that they would accept the patient. The Kuletha&amp;rsquo;s were exceptionally helpful in getting the legwork done for the Air-ambulance and the hospital admission in Dubai. Finally around 0200 on 01st July, we were able to get her medevac&amp;rsquo;d out of YaoundÃ©. Miss V and I head in the air ambulance with mummyjaan.  We make a technical stop in Nairobi and finally make it to Dubai that evening. Beyond glad, she handled the takeoffs and landings well. Once in Dubai, at Fakeeh University Hospital the moment we met and spoke to Dr. Sakib, I was convinced we were in safe hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days, under excellent observation and medical care, she recovered pretty well. On Friday, during the Angio, the doctors gave her a stent and reported the only artery that was blocked was the one that was serving the heart. We&amp;rsquo;d probably be looking at locomotive or cognitive impairment had it been somewhere else! So unluckily lucky! What a coincidence that she got her stent done on M&amp;rsquo;s birthday in the city that M was born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that bullet thwarted, I think we&amp;rsquo;d be remiss if we didn&amp;rsquo;t take some actionable steps. Need to get those baseline health checks in place. We&amp;rsquo;re going to stall anybody from visiting us until they have a Medevac insurance sorted out. I need to plan for more liquidity in my emergency funds given how cash-dependent this country is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has probably been the most stressful thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me in a while. Even when Amma was sick, I think I knew what to expect. We were sort of in a Catch22 situation here. The medical facilities weren&amp;rsquo;t quite kitted to handle cardiac issues and we had to stabilise her before we could even consider medevacing her for further care. Thankfully we had doctors in the family who were able to provide remote assistance and guided us with questions to ask. But for those vital family and friend connections, this could have ended up way differently&amp;hellip;So many things to be grateful for!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To the recent air-crash. To the Iran-Israel escalation. To the Israel-Palestine conflict. To the massive layoffs happening all over the federal space. To the incessant pollution on the roads. To the mindless spending all over. To the massive disparity across realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking over to &lt;em&gt;Masks&lt;/em&gt; for a couple drinks and that falafel burger. Playing &lt;em&gt;Breath of the WIld&lt;/em&gt; like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. Debating pros and cons of a neuro program in UCL. Ordering multiple T1000Es to tinker with. Planning future travel across waters. Living in this messed up world, raising a kid just like those gazillion out there who&amp;rsquo;re going to wonder what the heck their parents and ancestors did and did&amp;rsquo;nt do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this does not compute. Numb at so many levels&amp;hellip;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The short rainy season is almost about to end here. There&amp;rsquo;s still no dearth of monsoon drama though. A warm and humid afternoon leads in to a breezy evening. In just a few moments, it feels like you&amp;rsquo;ve been transported to a coastal town. The surrounding hills lock in the clouds and the barometric pressure drops. Denser dark clouds churn their way up and magnificently roll up the hills only to be forced down. Small static crackles lead in to thunderous lightnings, all in a matter of few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocooned in a hammock, music by the side with this little one observing all the moves and doling out a cascade of chuckles from things related and not. Little joys.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took an armored Land Cruiser out for a spin here on the hills and some dirt roads. SO MUCH FUN! It&amp;rsquo;s been several years that I&amp;rsquo;ve driven a stick-shift. Amazing how muscle memory just works.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went out with CLO for a drive through of the city. The downtown market reminded us of the Nakasura market in Kampala and the Moazzam Jahi market in Secunderabad.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was supposed to be a &amp;lsquo;Bridged&amp;rsquo; holiday. In this part of the world, the president apparently declares certain days to be holidays if they happen to fall adjacent to a previously declared public holiday and the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tomorrow being Cameroon day, rumor was that today would be one of those bridged holidays. Sadly it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Locally employed staff were definitely not happy. The Ambo did declare a 59 minute early release. Got the message while we were amidst a small project and not quite at a good stopping point. So we chugged along and head home when we were done. Will take it in spirit though. Merci Beaucoup! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/19/unbridged/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
