      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drove about 3 hours to visit the source of the #Nile. Decided to head to the &#39;Source of the Nile&#39; restaurant
on the west banks of the river instead of the more touristy &#39;Jinja&#39; side. I think it was a pretty good decision! Beautiful views from the hill and refreshingly windy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;70% of water apparently originates from Lake Victoria - Which in turn is fed by several streams from various regions nearby and 30% from springs or elsewhere&amp;hellip;Pretty surreal being there by the waters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive after Lugazi was pretty straight forward and actually more enjoyable than the section between #Kampala and Lugazi. Most of it was through the Mabira Forest which we went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2018/03/19/the-sky-captains-school/&#34;&gt;a few days back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow early AM, we head back to Boston. So glad we decided to &#39;close-out&#39; this #Uganda trip with the Nile visit!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visited the Wildlife Education center in Entebbe. Incredible experience!#Firsts - Petted a Cheetah on her terms in a controlled wild environment. Followed the guide into the enclosure (the size of a football field) locking the door behind us. He alerted the two cheetahs, calling their names and slowly moved towards them. The two hid amidst the bushes. We approached them cautiously from one end to another. Probably the size of a football field. One continued playing while the other stretched out and lounged on the grass. The guide first approached and petted her and we followed suit. A few minutes later the guide asked us to walk out slowly - us first and he right behind us. Still inside the enclosure for about five to ten minutes, the guide continued answering our questions. The cats were minding their own business least worried about our presence. Eventually got out of the enclosure.Never fathomed I&#39;d be this close to wild animals&amp;hellip;Insane experience. Subconsciously I did regulate my breathing with some deep breaths now and then&amp;hellip;Looking back, there was no plan B!#TIL Lions are the only cats that hunt in groups. The females hunt mostly for food. Males pitch in only when required and take care of the cubs when the females are out. Males get first dibs, followed by the cubs and only then the females get to eat. Alpha males become the leader of the pack. On some occasions, outcast lions tend to form a pack making them the strongest force in the forest. Quite similar to &#39;gangs&#39; on the street. While hunting the alpha picks one particular prey and the rest in the pack get the cue and help corner it down. Rest of the non-chosen one&#39;s are NOT attacked even if they&#39;re an easy target. #Firsts - Fed a Giraffe and learnt they&#39;re mostly silent! Their hearts are pretty big and weight about 10Kilos#Firsts - Met the insanely wise looking Shoebill! This one socializes by nodding its head downwards and &#39;clapping&#39; with its beak!#Firsts - Met about 20 chimps and realised how insanely similar they were to Humans. One little one was using a long twig to fetch bananas from the stream. Could easily pass off for a human kid. No kidding!#TIL about the Keystone Species! Reminded me about the Alabama Sturgeon and the introduction of wolves to save an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the drive back to #Kampala we were stuck in a traffic jam. A tempo wanting to cross over to the other side, decided to cut in from one of the feeder roads, essentially blocking the traffic on the opposite direction. Noticing this, the mini-van on the opposite side veered off the road and on to the sidewalk behind the tempo circumventing it and casually got back on the road. Other vehicles followed suite. I backed out a bit to let the tempo cross and he gleefully went his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely no horns or visual stress on any of the drivers! Can&#39;t imagine this happening in India. Absolutely love driving here!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/1521493439.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

As we enter Lugazi on route A109 towards Jinja, Google Maps suggests we take an unpaved dirt road on the left. The red slushy path meanders through small shops and houses and an eerie sense of awareness creeps in as villagers notice the Toyota Rav4 rolling into their &amp;lsquo;area&amp;rsquo;. I read last night that the 10km stretch to the Griffin falls camp area would be dirt roads winding through sugar-cane plantations. Last night&amp;rsquo;s rain and the incessant drizzle seem to have worsened the roads. Thankfully, the Rav4 handled the conditions insanely well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few kilometers in, direction signs to the camp lead us to the camp site. Looks like we&amp;rsquo;re the only two folks who&amp;rsquo;d be zip-lining today. Setup by &lt;a href=&#34;https://aaronblancharduganda.blogspot.ug/&#34;&gt;Aaron Blanchard&lt;/a&gt; a US Peace Corps volunteer &lt;a href=&#34;https://aaronblancharduganda.blogspot.ug/2014/02/&#34;&gt;in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mabiraforestcamp.com/super-skyway.php&#34;&gt;Mabira forest canopy super skyway&lt;/a&gt; is a phenomenal way to explore one of Central Uganda&amp;rsquo;s rainforests. After a short 15 minute walk in the woods from the campsite, the &amp;lsquo;Sky Captains&amp;rsquo; guide you up a ~40 ft tree from where you zip-line across the forest on five zips with the last one being a controlled repel between two 115 foot trees across the river Musamya. I&amp;rsquo;ve zip-lined a few times before, but never in a forest this high. Richard and Gerald - Our Sky captains did a terrific job showing us around and securely navigating us on the trees. Once off the zip system, Gerald led us to Griffin falls and then back to the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embed]https://vimeo.com/260921681[/embed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;River Musamya is heavily polluted by the Sugar factories upstream. Mabira forest by itself is on the cusp of heavy deforestation. The Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited (SCOUL) - Jointly owned by the Government of Uganda and The Mehta Group apparently planned to clear one-third of the forest area to create sugarcane plantations in 2007. With resistance from local non-profits and environment groups the government is seemingly caving in. Very recently, it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Conservation-Government-buy-off-Mabira-forest-residents/688334-4348562-ctstx5/index.html&#34;&gt;announced to buy-out the mabira forest residents&lt;/a&gt;. With all things environmental, politics and business we&amp;rsquo;d never really know where this balance is going to tilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way back, a guy from a village asked us to pull-over and checked if we could give him a ride to Lugazi. We were neutral but politely said we couldn&amp;rsquo;t. One of those times where you never really know what&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do in a foreign place&amp;hellip;Also, there apparently has been an underlying racial tension against Asians here since the Mehta group is an Indian firm and the Chinese too do seem to have a strong presence in the Sugar business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the drive back to Kampala, It struck me why I really like travelling or doing things outdoors. It&amp;rsquo;s just not about the activity that you end up doing, It&amp;rsquo;s the broader awareness that you get when you&amp;rsquo;re exposed to the framework that has led to the creation of that event.&lt;/p&gt;
