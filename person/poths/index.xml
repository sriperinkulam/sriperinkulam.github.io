      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between M&amp;amp;S taking ill earlier this week and the shutdown/furlough drama on Wednesday, last week whizzed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined the Poth&amp;rsquo;s for a game night on Friday. S and the kids watched &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; while we played a bunch of games. Building your empire, Skyjoy, Really bad art, and that one real interesting game which we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to play&amp;hellip;2100 and had to get S to bed to be ready for the Swim meet next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnected with D. Konduru after almost 6 years. Time files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com//2021/10/07/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt; popped in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; today. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember posting about this but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I saved it in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&amp;rsquo;s down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/&#34;&gt;almost 10 year old&lt;/a&gt; hard drive before it goes kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicale.org/v3.html&#34;&gt;Radicale&lt;/a&gt; instance in my homeserver and configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davx5.com/&#34;&gt;DAVx5&lt;/a&gt; on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
