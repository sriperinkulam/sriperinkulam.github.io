      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a fucking miserable day today&amp;rsquo;s been. Came home this evening to the Main breaker panel being down again. Called FAC. While we were figuring out the issue with the power, we heard OP was electrocuted while playing in his yard and didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. Such a freaking tragic loss. How do you even come to terms with shit like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, little one. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember your glowing eyes and sheepish grin as you &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34;&gt;won me in your empire&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you delicately handling your food when you came over to our place for dinner that night when you folks moved in to our block. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you sitting by the side of the embassy pool slowly contemplating if you wanted to get in or not. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you and J introducing me to your bunnies and you running all over your yard behind those bunnies. I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you and S running with those capes pretending to be superstars. And I so, so wish I got to know you more while you were around&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is so fucking fickle. Hug your dear ones&amp;rsquo; more than ever before. EVERY SINGLE DAY.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2026/01/15/op/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between M&amp;amp;S taking ill earlier this week and the shutdown/furlough drama on Wednesday, last week whizzed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined the Poth&amp;rsquo;s for a game night on Friday. S and the kids watched &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; while we played a bunch of games. Building your empire, Skyjoy, Really bad art, and that one real interesting game which we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to play&amp;hellip;2100 and had to get S to bed to be ready for the Swim meet next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnected with D. Konduru after almost 6 years. Time files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com//2021/10/07/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt; popped in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; today. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember posting about this but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I saved it in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&amp;rsquo;s down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/&#34;&gt;almost 10 year old&lt;/a&gt; hard drive before it goes kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicale.org/v3.html&#34;&gt;Radicale&lt;/a&gt; instance in my homeserver and configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davx5.com/&#34;&gt;DAVx5&lt;/a&gt; on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
