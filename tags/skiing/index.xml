      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convincing their parents last minute, Divyaa and Raaghuv drove up to Maryland with us. The kids had a ball of a time in the last row of the Sienna. We stopped over at Durham for the night and met Uncle Lou the next day for breakfast. Of course also visited Fuqua school of Business. Rajesh graduated from here and we so wished he was alive to show us around this campus. A gentle reminder to check-in with everyone near and dear every once in a while&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meena and I took the kids Skiing at Liberty on Thursday night. This has become more of a tradition now at year-end(beginning). A first for Raaghuv and Divyaa though. Just before we left, the boys decided to take on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libertymountainresort.com/interactive-map#close&#34;&gt;Lower blue streak&lt;/a&gt;, and I joined them. Absolutely reminded me of my first day at skiing! Need to work on that nuanced braking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and of course, Happy New Year! Last year I chose to be a bit more free, a privilege I am so glad I had and thankful for. Looking forward to what we chart in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/EtuykY&#34;&gt;Why more kids are learning — and enjoying — yoga&lt;/a&gt;: While yoga has become a fad now in the western world, I&amp;rsquo;d go further out to expand it to any activity that gets them out of a &amp;lsquo;controlled&amp;rsquo; space. My dream classroom would be one out in the open with minimal teacher intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/sBdxWP&#34;&gt;Why the French Don’t Show Excitement&lt;/a&gt;: While I like the idea of “&lt;em&gt;on est bien, là&lt;/em&gt;”, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a tough time getting that perceived cold shoulder in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/eHNn4g&#34;&gt;‘For five years we dreaded every meal’: my infant son’s struggle with food&lt;/a&gt;: They&amp;rsquo;re just so many things that could go wrong&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful Meena and Shasta are doing terrific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/krJguV&#34;&gt;Don’t just criticise the police. They’re constrained&lt;/a&gt;: As the world&amp;rsquo;s largest democracy comes to grips with the weight of the existence of more than a billion people, more so now as the youth are engaging and reacting to state and national politics, It&amp;rsquo;s key that funding and training is adequately increased to maintain law and order. And then there&amp;rsquo;s corruption to deal with&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sneaked in a day at Liberty at the very end of the skiing season. Was so totally worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meena didn&amp;rsquo;t get around taking the slopes since Shasta was pretty much tethered to her. Kids and I had a blast! Last time we were here [Dec 2017] I barely made it down the hill. This time around, I followed Nik&amp;rsquo;s strategy of letting gravity do it&amp;rsquo;s job and maneuvering only when I had to. Totally see how this could be addictive!&lt;/p&gt;
