      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got home pretty late yesterday night after a small get together at &lt;a href=&#34;http://hyderabadjournal.wordpress.com/2008/03/22/papaji-da-dhabha/&#34; title=&#34;Where is this?&#34;&gt;Papaji da dhaba.&lt;/a&gt; No particular reason as such. Pavan had come to Hyd for a short visit post his training at Satyam- Chennai. Besides, Aditya and I are leaving for Pune this week on a short term transfer. Four of us ( Abi being the fourth) were more or less room mates all through our Engineering lyf at Kanchi. To spruce things up we had Domz joining us :-) . Doma is one hell of a person to be with! All thanks to his childish innocence! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was in no mood to sleep after getting back home. So i picked up my Guitar to try a few notes. It&amp;rsquo;s actually been quite a while that I&amp;rsquo;ve laid my hands on it. Somehow things kept me busy and getting back to the Guitar was one beautiful experience. A couple of months back while at Bangalore, I &amp;rsquo;d learnt to play KHNH&amp;rsquo;s theme song. With no practice, KHNH doles out pretty bad from my hands now but it&amp;rsquo;s only a few days before I get back to my professional level ;-) .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now there&amp;rsquo;s this Pune transfer lurking round the corner :-( !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost been a week that I&amp;rsquo;ve been attending Guitar classes&amp;hellip;Today&amp;rsquo;s been the worst day! :-(&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Had a really bad day yesterday regarding a few petty issues..Slept at about 1:00 am and when at 6:15 am my cell started beeping, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the mood to hop out of bed. After a few minutes of incessant flipping, I managed to shred the lazy soul; had a cup of coffee and even then was contemplating on whether I really did want to go to Melowings. Anyways, just drove down to the place .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practised yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lessons for a few minutes and started the &amp;ldquo;Sparkling star&amp;rdquo; note. ( Never mind, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of that, It&amp;rsquo;s the same &amp;ldquo;Twinkle Twinkle little star&amp;rdquo; rhyme&amp;hellip;They probably call it that way, just to keep your ego at bay.) Practised for ten minutes or so , only when it struck me I wasn&amp;rsquo;t playing what i was supposed to play :-) All that I was doing was striking the cords in an arbitrary fashion unknowingly (trying to crack new notes huh! )Whatever I did , I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t gather the concentration to play the guitar. And when my lack of concentration reached it&amp;rsquo;s peak, I just walked out of the room promising to get back tomorrow with a livened spirit&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what&amp;rsquo;s in store tomorrow ..oops today, It&amp;rsquo;s already 12:15 am :-) I better hit the bed now, lest I have to write another post tomorrow morning&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
