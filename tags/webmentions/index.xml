&lt;p&gt;Need to figure out why certain #webmentions from my site are being sent as anonymous. Adding that to my ever expanding list of to-do&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started tweaking my portal and started getting deeper into the code, there&amp;rsquo;s been a constant fire in my brain to further tweak and tinker with things. This is addictive!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent sometime today troubleshooting two pesky issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having switched to a new theme I realized my publishing workflow wasn&amp;rsquo;t fetching comments from Instagram posts. The Dsgnwrks plugin was fetching the images fine.  But since I&amp;rsquo;d missed adding the syndication link for brid.gy to work its magic, the comments were not being back fed. This should be an easy fix. Probably I&amp;rsquo;ll use the custom fields that dsgnwrks creates and update syndication links field using  a quick custom function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue was that the new theme wasn&amp;rsquo;t displaying webmentions. What should have been a quick fix, took me some time to figure out that the comment block was only being called if there were any &amp;lsquo;comment&amp;rsquo; type comments. Quickly added an &amp;lsquo;or&amp;rsquo; to check for &amp;lsquo;webmention&amp;rsquo; type comments too and that was set. One of those pesky &amp;lsquo;must have caught earlier&amp;rsquo; issues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that these have been sorted out, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably work on displaying these &amp;rsquo;likes&amp;rsquo; as facepiles.&lt;/p&gt;
