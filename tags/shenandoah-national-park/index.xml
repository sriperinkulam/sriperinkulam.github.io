&lt;p&gt;Appa&amp;rsquo;s been mentioning Luray Caverns for a while now, so we decided to head there this weekend. He did pretty well despite his knees giving him a tough time. &amp;lsquo;Oh so worth it. Simbly beautiful&amp;rsquo; - his words!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at it, we got our annual national parks pass and decided to do the scenic drive in Shenandoah. S had a terrific time hopping on top of the car and addressing the wilderness at almost every pull-over area.&lt;/p&gt;
