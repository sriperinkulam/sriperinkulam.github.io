      <description>&lt;p&gt;These fishermen in their catamarans were slowly yet gleefully making their way back to the coastline early AM. Likely a terrific catch that they could sell back on land? Or was it just another day in the waters making ends meet, doing what they love and loving what they do?&lt;/p&gt;

A wonderful morning run on the Marina today. Barefoot as always!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a &amp;lsquo;gloomy&amp;rsquo; weather and not many visitors this early morning, we had most of the beach all for ourselves! As S and I were just about turning around after reaching Ice House, the slight drizzle very soon turned into a full fledged rain. Pouring rain, early morning waves and an empty beach is something I could take in every single day! Shasta seemed to have a terrific time too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meena happened to click this picture of us running from the distance. So glad she got around capturing this moment!&lt;/p&gt;
