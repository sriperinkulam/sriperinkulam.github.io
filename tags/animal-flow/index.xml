      <description>&lt;p&gt;This sounds pretty interesting, Philip. Something I should consider adding to my workout regimen. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a tough time coordinating my limbs and following flow sequences. Several years back after a failed attempt at learning &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalaripayattu&#34;&gt;Kalaripayettu&lt;/a&gt; , I was heavily demoralized. My flexibility seemed to be abysmally low and I had a real tough time getting back to group classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month my wife finally got me to sign up for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtanga_vinyasa_yoga&#34;&gt;Ashtanga Yoga&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s only been a few weeks and I already see tremendous improvement in my ability to focus, coordinate my moves and remember sequences. I guess the break in between was much needed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most recent addition to my movement practice, just started, is animal movements. These are basically just ground exercises where the shapes are inspired by animal movements: Bear and Crab crawls, Ape and Duck walks, transitions from one to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
