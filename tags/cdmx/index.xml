&lt;p&gt;Not quite sure, what triggered it but S was super upset this morning. She walked over to the &amp;lsquo;sun&amp;rsquo; room and stood there for a good twenty minutes. And just like that she totally forgot about it all&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/22/upset/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleague gifted me a walking pole engraved with everybody&amp;rsquo;s names as a going away gift. Loved it! The OBO RSTs got me some mezcal. Just in time before the packout tomorrow. Still got a week left here but boy, I am going to miss this bunch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since we got her training wheels off, S has been nervous riding down the small hill near the Chapultapec zoo for some reason. M convinced S to ride on Reforma one last time today. She nailed it! Rode all the way to the Angel statue and back without any fuss. With the movers packing all our things this thursday, this would probably be our last ride on Reforma! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/16/last-reforma-ride/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back from a seemingly long but super-productive trip to Matamoros/Brownsville. This would be my last TDY while here in Mexico City. We went in body-heavy and it did pay-off. A good bunch of cables were pulled and cameras fixed. The weather was impeccable. With gusty winds, super dark and bearing clouds and temperatures barely hitting the 50s - It was perfect outdoor work weather. More so high up on an extended ladder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to meet the Candadai&amp;rsquo;s the day I landed. They own a property right by a beautiful irrigation canal and this place reminded me of the serene back-waters in Kerala. I totally see myself retiring in a place like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;rsquo;s offer got rescinded because of the hiring freeze. Super bummed but I guess the writing was on the wall. Well, at least there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more clarity now and we can plan our home leave together. The new administration is pushing quite a changes. I&amp;rsquo;m all for productivity and efficiency but I don&amp;rsquo;t quite think they really see or understand the scope of what they&amp;rsquo;re pushing out. With direct impacts, for now it&amp;rsquo;s a wait and act game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Matamoros TDY done, I can now shift gears at work and throttle up the check-out procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone added &lt;em&gt;Cliffs of Dover&lt;/em&gt; to the Barnyard Burger&amp;rsquo;s Jukebox. Been years that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this song! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/31/matamoros/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 21:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/19/la-malinche-hike/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I type this note, my right forefinger has a sensation I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt before. It&amp;rsquo;s mildly numb yet fully functional. M tells me later this evening maybe a nerve is probably still chilling in there. Maybe this is how frostbite feels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this morning Adam, Jacob and I head out from the cabin around 0150 towards the Malinche trailhead. M checked with some of the locals in town last evening and they mentioned most guided hikes start around 0200 to get to the peak in time for sunrise. We decided to go without a guide since the trail was straightforward and I was reasonably optimistic I could guide the group myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful 3/4 moon night and the moonlight is just sufficient to light most of our path. With temperature skirting just around freezing, Adam realizes he&amp;rsquo;s forgotten his second jacket. We head back to the cabin,grab it and get back to the trail. Around 20 minutes in, we lose the trail. Only later on our way back will we realise that this trail atleast initially switches in and out of the emergency paved route that winds up close to the summit. Thankfully we notice hikers headlamps flashing on the actual trail and bushwack our way to the correct path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my right knee in not a great condition, I&amp;rsquo;d warned the boys we&amp;rsquo;d be taking this one slow. The path is relentlessly demanding with a steady 30&amp;rsquo; gradient. We had to cover about 4500 ft. elevation gain in about 4 hrs if we wanted to catch sunrise at the summit. We take breaks as needed but keep a decent steady pace. About 1.5hrs in, Malinche reveals itself right in between the foliage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/MalincheFirstSight.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Malinche by the moonlight&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 0545, ~13862ft, it feels as if there&amp;rsquo;s a sudden cold front. We layer up as we get to the alpine zone. The scree is mostly frozen and there&amp;rsquo;s quite some ice patches on the path. Neither Adam nor Jacob had brought their gloves. I smack myself for not checking with them before we left the cabin. The three of us take turns sharing the single pair of gloves I had and truck along - one step in front of another. Slowly but surely the summit comes to our line of sight. There&amp;rsquo;re maybe about 70/80 people already trying to summit ahead of us - their headlamps glimmering in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Malinche0500.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Malinche summit about 500ft away&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around 0600 and 14108ft, we hit a narrow bottleneck with a slick ice patch slowing people down. I&amp;rsquo;m beyond concerned none of them are wearing microspikes or crampons. Well, Adam and Jacob don&amp;rsquo;t have it too. Adam mentioned his shoe didn&amp;rsquo;t have much grip either! I hand him over my microspikes and we head a bit further up. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m mentally prepared to turn around and flag this to both of them. My main concern was the cold and us not having the right gear to make our way back. With dawn kicking in, ice melt was imminent and there was no way we&amp;rsquo;d be able to safely get down. We decide to trot up a bit more and hit another bottleneck around the knife-edge that would give us direct view of the summit. About ~400 ft maybe and the summit was right there. On our turn, Adam and Jacob are able to barely make it up the pivot and I&amp;rsquo;m constantly slipping - with no microspikes. Decide to call it a day and turn around. The boys aren&amp;rsquo;t super happy with the decision but agree. On the way down we see a taste of what we&amp;rsquo;d have to endure had we continued on. But for a few minor slips we make it below the alpine range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/MalicheProxySummit.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Maliche Proxy Summit&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, this weekend, Deepa was hiking Nevado De Toluca and Jordan was doing a multi summit hike to Izta and Pico de Orizaba. We&amp;rsquo;d hear later that they had conducive conditions and were able to summit the peaks just as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/MalinchePano.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Maliche Pano&#34;  /&gt;

&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/OrizabaByDawn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Orizaba by Dawn&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make it back to the Malintzi Cabin around 0945. A quick breakfast and we make our way back to CDMX around 1400. The stay at the cabin was great and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we decided to stay overnight here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Malinche off my list now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty undecided on Orizaba. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably give it a bit more thought after the Matamoros trip.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided not to drive to GDL for Carlos&amp;rsquo; wedding. Just not comfortable driving the GV until we get it properly serviced. Thankfully, we got a flight last minute and we head straight to the GDL zoo after landing. S has been wanting to see the penguins there for quite sometime now and what better opportunity than this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zoo was immaculately maintained! And with the Sky-cables and trains, this was such a great experience. We checked in at the AC hotel for some short down time and then head to an Arabic restaurant for some pretty delicious wraps because we were quite certain M wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything vegetarian at the wedding. The wedding per se was super intimate with about 30 guests. I am glad we were able to fit this in despite a pretty packed end of the year. We head back to the hotel around 1145 just about when S was nearing her &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m done&lt;/em&gt; limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/carlos_gdl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we head to the vegan restaurant that M had scouted for a quick breakfast and get to the GDL airport just in time for the flight back to CDMX.

      <guid>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/las-estacas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;V+D were visiting us for a few days around Christmas this year. With the 24th declared a holiday, M suggested we go glamping in Estacas for a night. S loved the idea and we booked two tents for the five of us. Cost was super reasonable given it included breakfast and entry to the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/estacas.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only got to Estacas around 1400 on 24th evening thanks to the four hours we lost to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/&#34;&gt;brake fade on the Grand Vitara&lt;/a&gt;. After a quick check-in, we decide to rent a kayak and row down the stream. I hop off the kayak and swim upstream. S was bent on going to the kids pool alone and not getting into the spring. After about an hour, S &amp;amp; I head to the kids pool. She spends maybe 30 mins in there and calls it a day. Her only ask was that we have dinner by the spring, which we gladly agree to since that&amp;rsquo;s the only restaurant that was open. After dinner, S was sleepy but still super excited about spending the night in the tent. Happy kid, Happy camper! She sleeps through the night despite all the Christmas fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/shas_estacas.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wake up to a super crisp and nippy 25th morning. V and I decide to snorkel/swim in the warm 23C spring water. We spot some sleeping turtles and a great many schools of fish feasting on their morning find. After a simple yet delicious breakfast we make our way back to CDMX. Probably one of our best stays in Estacas so far and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we decided to glamp! Though S didn&amp;rsquo;t get into the spring, she absolutely enjoyed our trip. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/las-estacas/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>V+D were visiting us for a few days around Christmas this year. With the 24th declared a holiday, M suggested we go glamping in Estacas for a night. S loved the idea and we booked two tents for the five of us. Cost was super reasonable given it included breakfast and entry to the park.</p>

<p>We only got to Estacas around 1400 on 24th evening thanks to the four hours we lost to the <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/">brake fade on the Grand Vitara</a>. After a quick check-in, we decide to rent a kayak and row down the stream. I hop off the kayak and swim upstream. S was bent on going to the kids pool alone and not getting into the spring. After about an hour, S &amp; I head to the kids pool. She spends maybe 30 mins in there and calls it a day. Her only ask was that we have dinner by the spring, which we gladly agree to since that&rsquo;s the only restaurant that was open. After dinner, S was sleepy but still super excited about spending the night in the tent. Happy kid, Happy camper! She sleeps through the night despite all the Christmas fireworks.</p>

<p>We wake up to a super crisp and nippy 25th morning. V and I decide to snorkel/swim in the warm 23C spring water. We spot some sleeping turtles and a great many schools of fish feasting on their morning find. After a simple yet delicious breakfast we make our way back to CDMX. Probably one of our best stays in Estacas so far and I&rsquo;m so glad we decided to glamp! Though S didn&rsquo;t get into the spring, she absolutely enjoyed our trip. <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/las-estacas/" style="text-decoration: none !important;">ðŸ”—</a>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back from a productive work trip in Merida. Overall, I think it went great. Most of the planning over the last few months paid off and but for a few minor issues, we were able top wrap up coring the NCC in about three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also found a few fantastic food options through the week. For lunch we mostly had to do an Uber eats since there weren&amp;rsquo;t many options around the new consulate. &lt;a href=&#34;https://habaneros.com.mx/&#34;&gt;Habaneros&lt;/a&gt; was the find of the week though. Their &lt;em&gt;Pimitos&lt;/em&gt; was on point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would most likely be my last work-trip to Merida. Time for some transition planning to hand the baton over.&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/20/merida/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
