      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exactly a decade ago, I landed on Posterous Spaces. This was before any of the currently common messaging platforms that exist were built. M wanted a way to backup texts and at that point in time, Posterous Spaces looked like a terrific option. We&amp;rsquo;d email the texts over to an email address and they&amp;rsquo;d be published as private posts on our domain. All was good until Twitter acquired them and non-nonchalantly shut them down in 2012. Interestingly, they still have the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.posterous.com/&#34;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; active! The co-founders went on to build &lt;a href=&#34;https://posthaven.com/our_pledge&#34;&gt;Posthaven&lt;/a&gt; which I believe is still pretty active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Posterous Spaces shutdown, for whatever reason, I missed downloading the export and with that all those messages vanished. Or so I thought until today when I chanced upon some old e-mails and found copies of those sent texts. The mother of all decentralization tools - E-mail to the rescue! The next mini project is to convert these emails to a more digestible format. Decades from now, I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued to see which of the current backup mechanisms will stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
