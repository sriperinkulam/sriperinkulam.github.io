      <description>&lt;p&gt;Couple of  hours back I opened my student tracker,  just sat back and started mulling over how each of my kids have changed over the past few months. As I went through the list reading each of the kids names, images of the kid kept flashing in and out of my mind and most of them, so turned out to be of those moments when they were being ecstatic or really happy. This made me wonder how we as humans tend to capture/remember only the positives or the cheerful part in our relationships. But as a teacher, am I not failing my kids in not noticing their negative behaviour and working to get them back to their normal self? Am I doing justice to them by not stopping what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and not taking that extra time to pay attention to that minuscule behavioral change? How many times have I swept a behavioral change under the blanket and continued with my class/session? How many times have I &amp;rsquo;neglected&amp;rsquo; a kid in the rush to finish off a topic/objective?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sadly in retrospect I seem to recollect more than one occasions where I&amp;rsquo;ve failed noticing/paying heed to the change. This could probably be one of those reasons why a particular kid did not perform well in a particular objective; a reason why a particular kid did not receive me with the same enthusiasm as he otherwise would have and this is something I&amp;rsquo;m really beginning to appreciate in this role as a teacher. Every moment in the classroom you end up dealing with the emotions of 46 kids out there. Human to human interaction is the utmost priority. When I go back to my classroom in twenty days for the second term, this is one thing that I have to keep in mind always.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Talking by numbers, my kids have progressed from a class average of 25% to 56% in Math, from 17% to 59% in Grammer and from 28%[-0.1 Grade] to 85%[1.5 Grade] in RC. Thats some significant progress that the class has made. But again, the class average does not necessarily represent the overall growth of the classroom. There still are kids like - Sarfaraz, Nabil, Aditya More, Meghana and Yash Pawar who need to make tremendous progress if they have to be on par with the other kids. I guess that is where the main challenge lies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, I visualize my classroom as a circular board resting on a pivot. I being the pivot and the circular board,  a playground where my 46 little ones decide the dynamics of the classroom from inside. My responsibility is to  maintain the equilibrium and I need to be extremely flexible so as to adjust and re-position to the external stimuli and the dynamics created by my kids so that the whole system remains in equilibrium &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt;. The next fortnight I guess is all about figuring out how to maintain that equilibrium, about how I push myself to my limits of being flexible and making that transformation something sustainable&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Gut Instinct, Twitter and My Career</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to wake up in the morning and find the day ahead unpredictable. I wanted to think on my toes and look for a challenging day ahead that would need me to take decisions on the fly. I wanted to have a slice of &amp;lsquo;adventure&amp;rsquo; every day in my life. Over time I realised its more promising to trust your gut instinct than anything else. I personally feel relying on &amp;lsquo;gut instinct&amp;rsquo; is not just doing things impulsively but It&amp;rsquo;s more about taking decisions on the fly which inherently is strengthened over time based on your past experiences through a subconscious thought process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year and a half back I signed off my &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;../2008/07/the-it-mirage/&#34;&gt;one year in IT&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; post with this statement- &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Probably I’ll be doing something starkly different next year or for all you know still be eluded by the mirage of recognition all the way lamenting ‘C’est la Vie ‘ and keep moving&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rsquo; Little did I realise what was concocting. I should have seen this coming way back then. Three months from now I&amp;rsquo;ll be making a paradigm shift in my career and what else do I attribute this to but for &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/rohan_kini/status/3665859697&#34;&gt;one of Rohan Kini&amp;rsquo;s tweet!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;imgs/20241208-013310.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess its time I unofficially announce [For records!] my decision to move out of  the role of a Software engineer and walk into the role of a teacher.  I was intimated on my selection for this fellowship on Nov 30th itself  but I guess it took me another two months to digest the fact. I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining a team of 150 fellows selected from various professions all across the country to mentor kids in low income schools. For two whole years, as a fellow of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.teachforindia.org/&#34;&gt;Teach for India&lt;/a&gt;, I would be working with the kids, their communities and their familes to help improve the literacy numbers. The very thought that I would be responsible in moulding the lifes of about fifty kids over a span of two years sends a chill down my spine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been an excruciating three whole months process and I still remember checking my mail every half an hour on my mobile on Nov 30th awaiting the confirmation response from the team. [I probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t this anxious even during my Infosys interview!] I applied for the fellowship right the next day I got to hear about the program through Rohans&amp;rsquo; tweet. Initially I assumed this would be a cakewalk. But after a couple of days the structured process that was in place to take in the second set of fellows became evident. SOPs, Recommendation letters, Telephonic interviews and a day long in-person interview  - Boy, I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t prepared for all this! I in fact didn&amp;rsquo;t even inform my family members till the day of the Assessment interview!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Post my selection, life&amp;rsquo;s been a bit different. People kind of do not look at me the same way. All optimistic views aside, moving out of a stable job to unknown realms is at times unnerving. I&amp;rsquo;ve been receiving mixed responses from my colleagues and friends when they get to hear about my decision. It at times bothers when you hear your colleagues earning a higher pay as they switch jobs. To be frank, in the initial few days I was even thinking of scrapping all plans and banking on the safe job that I had. But as I got to speak to the current fellows and the program co-ordinators things really got better. A much deeper analysis and ground work put things on the brighter perspective. Besides this decision also had direct implication on what I wanted to do ever since I started teaching at the Arundati upper primary school. That one day changed the way I looked at things. Just two hours and I was already emphasizing on the need for a much regular workable model to help the kids improve and I guess this is where my gut instinct played a vital role. If I was not interested in the program I simply wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have applied for the fellowship impromptu. With that single ideology I sent in my confirmation on Dec &amp;lsquo;07th despite having time till Jan 03rd.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next two years is probably going to be the best learning experience I could ask for. I would need to work on issues I&amp;rsquo;ve never thought of  and look at things from a grass root level perspective. I would need to think twice before I spend every pie from my pocket and learn to un-learn some things that &amp;lsquo;corporate life&amp;rsquo; has taught me. I would need to think out of the box and bring about innovative ideas to help improve the current scenario. To be frank, I still do not have a clear cut picture as to what I should/would be doing post this fellowship. Guess I&amp;rsquo;ll take it in stride and figure out things as they roll out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I came across this talk by the CEO of Teach For India - Shaheen Mistry at the TEDxASB event. You seriously need to watch this to see what this is all about. Nothing short of a three stomped salute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;p style=&amp;ldquo;text-align:justify&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;India as a developing nation needs institutions such as this to help bring about change. Change in the way we respond to the seething demons that are deep rooted in our day to day lives. Unless Illiteracy, Poverty and Corruption are brought under control, there&amp;rsquo;s remote chance that we as a Nation stand to a glorious future. Philanthropy or Altruism come nowhere in the picture. All that is required is human force that believes in setting things straight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
