      <description>&lt;p&gt;Met a couple friends and their familes on a short hike up the Pallavaram hills. Was good catching up after a while! Despite temperature being in the high 80s, the kids had a terrific time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the organizing front though, I could have done better. We initially planned to meet at 10:00 but ended up climbing around 11:30 due to travel delays. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t carrying my first-aid kit and the usual pick-me-up edibles/tailwind. I missed checking on everybody&amp;rsquo;s general health condition prior to the climb. Had the trail been a few more miles longer, with the rising temps, things could have escalated pretty quickly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, thankfully all went well. Time to get back into those planning shoes and dust off my hike leaders hat.&lt;/p&gt;
