      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just published Appa&amp;rsquo;s first book - &amp;lsquo;Smell of the Soil&amp;rsquo; in print format. This has been on his (and my) &amp;rsquo;to-do&amp;rsquo; list for a while now. We did publish the digital version in December 2017 and looking back makes me wonder why we didn&amp;rsquo;t publish the print version earlier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years that he&amp;rsquo;s been wanting to do this and we&amp;rsquo;ve had quite some discussion on what&amp;rsquo;s the best way to publish/market and never quite came to a consensus. Today, on an impulse, I hit the publish button with a small publishing firm in India and ordered the first copy for myself. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get my hands on it and send him a copy!&lt;/p&gt;
