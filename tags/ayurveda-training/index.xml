      <description>&lt;p&gt;Miss Me started her Ayurveda Training 101 this weekend. Super excited about the things she&amp;rsquo;s going to learn. Her instructor has been an Ayurveda consultant for about 20 years now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been following her recipes for the last few months and it definitely has introduced us to some new and tasty meals. Yesterday they were handed over copper tongue cleaners and asked to analyze and see if they notice any changes in their digestion over the next few weeks. Boiled water consumption was another thing that she&amp;rsquo;s been recommended to do. Feels like going back to square 1 &amp;lsquo;in a good way&amp;rsquo;. Remember Amma and TVM doing these things when we were kids. Somewhere down the lane we stopped practicing those &amp;lsquo;principles&amp;rsquo; and it now seems to be back in full circle as Meena starts the course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
