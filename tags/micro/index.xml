      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to implement something similar to DayOne. Essentially a place where I can dive in and jot quick notes for that day - not having to worry about frontmatter, templates etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might have to do some minor tweaks on how images are displayed here similar to the photos page&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;M went over to the Jewish neighborhood in Centro Historico for the Post Language Program trip. S &amp;amp; I stayed back. Got some paperwork done for our visas. Walked over to El JardÃ­n EscÃ©nico on Reforma and from there head over to Ehden Restaurant to meet the PLP group there. Some decent Lebanese food, a delicious date cake and a TERRIFIC arabic coffee!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tinkered a bit with my Matrix installation. Upgrade went smooth but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to backfill my messages in &lt;em&gt;Element&lt;/em&gt;. Looks like the rooms get added back in only when some new message comes in. No biggie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The packers came in today and boxed up most of our belongings. We&amp;rsquo;d already sorted stuff pretty decently, so they barely needed our intervention. Another team should come in tomorrow to load these out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

M convinced S to ride on Reforma one last time today. She nailed it! Rode all the way to the Angel statue and back without any fuss. With the movers packing all our things this thursday, this would probably be our last ride on Reforma! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/16/last-reforma-ride/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got barely two weeks left here in CDMX! As with any move, we&amp;rsquo;ve been trimming our holdings down. Still amazed that I can fit almost all of my vital belongings into two 50 lbs suitcases. As a family our holdings weighed about 3000 lbs in total when we moved to Mexico city. Pretty sure we should be in that ball-park for this move too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Made the tough call NOT to hike Orizaba the coming weekend. I think I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the mind space to plan it all out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Decided to let go of the 3D Printer I bought from a colleague last year. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time to tinker with it and it just sank in, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a tough time getting the supplies shipped over to Yaounde. Some indulgences - invested or not - are probably just worth letting go!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tweaked my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/05/implementing-static-comments/&#34;&gt;comments code&lt;/a&gt; to send notifications to my NTFY channel when this site receives spam - just for kicks. And boy, it does seem to work. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/12/time/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Implementing static comments</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/05/implementing-static-comments/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/comments.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I bit the bullet and setup a rudimentary comment system for this site. For the last few months, I relied on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isso-comments/isso/&#34;&gt;ISSO&lt;/a&gt;, but it kinda felt a bit too heavy. Finally scratched the itch and switched over to a basic form and some javascript to push comments over to my self-hosted ntfy server. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve left the moderation to manual mode - I have to copy over the comments manually from NTFY to a comments.json file. A GO script that usually publishes this site also builds the comments for each of the posts as needed  based on the posts&amp;rsquo; permalink. Pretty friction-less and nifty! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/05/implementing-static-comments/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NO &lt;a href=&#34;https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/ciudad-de-mexico/miguel-hidalgo_1999281/restaurant/mari-gold&#34;&gt;Mari Gold&lt;/a&gt; ! You don&amp;rsquo;t get to call - a wrap of leaf salad drizzled with vinagarette and some flavorless yam, doused in running egg yolk - a KATHI ROLL! Such a disgrace! Wasn&amp;rsquo;t too excited about going here initially and now I&amp;rsquo;m more than convinced not to look back once.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/25/mari-gold/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

Still a bunch of tweaks to make this look better but super happy with how this is shaping. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/24/mapping-gpx/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Blue Dell alert</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/13/blue-dell-alert/</link>

      <guid>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/13/blue-dell-alert/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around 0300 today, I was woken up rudely to a blaring sound. For a moment I assumed it was from the Seismic City alert system that CDMX has. Turned out, it was from the old blue dell laptop that I currently use to run NextcloudPi. For some reason, looks like it rebooted and went into a huge panic mode because it lost time sync. Yanked all the cables and shut it down. Something to figure out over the next few days when I have time. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/13/blue-dell-alert/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;/s This turned out to be simpler than I thought. All I had to do was add all the libraries to the overdriive account on the desktop. And then login to that overdrive account on the Kobo. By design, only one card shows on the Kobo. To borrow books from a library not shown on the Kobo, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to fetch that on a separate device. So simple!  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/10/clara/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Houston calling</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/05/houston-calling/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make it to Houston during S&amp;rsquo; Christmas break, because we very well knew we might not come here during our home leave. Oh boy, what a trip this has been in terms of travel snafus! On our way there we got routed to San Antonio and got grounded for a couple hours because of inclement weather en-route.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/houston.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we thought we missed our connection in Dallas because of a delayed departure from Houston, and re-booked for a later flight from Dallas. However, our connecting flight was delayed too and when I checked at the counter in Dallas if we could get switched back to our previous booking, the attendant said that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible. M however was adamant and worked her magic. Looks like they had a &amp;lsquo;weight restriction&amp;rsquo; on the flight and M was able to convince them to flip back our reservations since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to check-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trip otherwise was pretty uneventful. Some good time with family, speckled with delicious home cooked food and some oh-so-okay outside food. Also note-to-self to make these trips shorter to just about two nights instead of week-long.&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/05/houston-calling/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Carlos&#39; wedding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided not to drive to GDL for Carlos&amp;rsquo; wedding. Just not comfortable driving the GV until we get it properly serviced. Thankfully, we got a flight last minute and we head straight to the GDL zoo after landing. S has been wanting to see the penguins there for quite sometime now and what better opportunity than this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The zoo was immaculately maintained! And with the Sky-cables and trains, this was such a great experience. We checked in at the AC hotel for some short down time and then head to an Arabic restaurant for some pretty delicious wraps because we were quite certain M wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything vegetarian at the wedding. The wedding per se was super intimate with about 30 guests. I am glad we were able to fit this in despite a pretty packed end of the year. We head back to the hotel around 1145 just about when S was nearing her &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m done&lt;/em&gt; limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/carlos_gdl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we head to the vegan restaurant that M had scouted for a quick breakfast and get to the GDL airport just in time for the flight back to CDMX.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/29/carlos-wedding/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Las Estacas</title>
      <link>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/las-estacas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;V+D were visiting us for a few days around Christmas this year. With the 24th declared a holiday, M suggested we go glamping in Estacas for a night. S loved the idea and we booked two tents for the five of us. Cost was super reasonable given it included breakfast and entry to the park.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/estacas.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We only got to Estacas around 1400 on 24th evening thanks to the four hours we lost to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/brake-fade/&#34;&gt;brake fade on the Grand Vitara&lt;/a&gt;. After a quick check-in, we decide to rent a kayak and row down the stream. I hop off the kayak and swim upstream. S was bent on going to the kids pool alone and not getting into the spring. After about an hour, S &amp;amp; I head to the kids pool. She spends maybe 30 mins in there and calls it a day. Her only ask was that we have dinner by the spring, which we gladly agree to since that&amp;rsquo;s the only restaurant that was open. After dinner, S was sleepy but still super excited about spending the night in the tent. Happy kid, Happy camper! She sleeps through the night despite all the Christmas fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/shas_estacas.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We wake up to a super crisp and nippy 25th morning. V and I decide to snorkel/swim in the warm 23C spring water. We spot some sleeping turtles and a great many schools of fish feasting on their morning find. After a simple yet delicious breakfast we make our way back to CDMX. Probably one of our best stays in Estacas so far and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we decided to glamp! Though S didn&amp;rsquo;t get into the spring, she absolutely enjoyed our trip. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/24/las-estacas/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
