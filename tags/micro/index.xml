      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d initially planned on visiting HongKong to celebrate Patti&amp;rsquo;s 80th and then head to India for a short trip for our R&amp;amp;R. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/07/04/stented/&#34;&gt;Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s heart decided nah-ah&lt;/a&gt; and we ended up in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/dubai&#34;&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. Once I knew she was stable and was receiving the care she needed, I decided to head to India. In a week, I covered 6 cities spending barely a night in each place. &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/pune/&#34;&gt;Visiting Pune&lt;/a&gt; was most fulfilling. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to meet friends that I planned to meet in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; but got some local sightseeing checked off the list for family. Was great meeting family in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ahmedabad&#34;&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; but I am NOT going back there in summer. So glad I made it to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/trivandrum&#34;&gt;Trivandrum&lt;/a&gt; to meet Raju Mama. Drive to &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/ernakulam&#34;&gt;Ernakulam&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite planned but I guess that happened. Always fun visiting Ron in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/bangalore&#34;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; but the flying &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../location/madras&#34;&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; trip was one last minute surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I got to meet some friends and family, In hindsight, this trip was nuts. Way too much travel and strain. I think henceforth, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to stay a bit longer in one city and have whoever wants to meet come over. We&amp;rsquo;d initially cost-constructed this trip. Turned out to be one hell of a cost-construct! Just so happy to be back home!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got an official notification confirming that I was tenured a
month ago. Yay! Pleasantly surprised. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mean much, I guess, under the current administration. The recent RIF plans don&amp;rsquo;t quite bode well for domestic folks and rumor is that overseas positions are up next. Should have more clarity over the next few days. All I need though is just a few more weeks to clock in those three years and get the whole benefit of the TSP.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To the recent air-crash. To the Iran-Israel escalation. To the Israel-Palestine conflict. To the massive layoffs happening all over the federal space. To the incessant pollution on the roads. To the mindless spending all over. To the massive disparity across realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking over to &lt;em&gt;Masks&lt;/em&gt; for a couple drinks and that falafel burger. Playing &lt;em&gt;Breath of the WIld&lt;/em&gt; like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. Debating pros and cons of a neuro program in UCL. Ordering multiple T1000Es to tinker with. Planning future travel across waters. Living in this messed up world, raising a kid just like those gazillion out there who&amp;rsquo;re going to wonder what the heck their parents and ancestors did and did&amp;rsquo;nt do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this does not compute. Numb at so many levels&amp;hellip;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The short rainy season is almost about to end here. There&amp;rsquo;s still no dearth of monsoon drama though. A warm and humid afternoon leads in to a breezy evening. In just a few moments, it feels like you&amp;rsquo;ve been transported to a coastal town. The surrounding hills lock in the clouds and the barometric pressure drops. Denser dark clouds churn their way up and magnificently roll up the hills only to be forced down. Small static crackles lead in to thunderous lightnings, all in a matter of few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocooned in a hammock, music by the side with this little one observing all the moves and doling out a cascade of chuckles from things related and not. Little joys.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took an armored Land Cruiser out for a spin here on the hills and some dirt roads. SO MUCH FUN! It&amp;rsquo;s been several years that I&amp;rsquo;ve driven a stick-shift. Amazing how muscle memory just works.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bailing out to the new media - Will we though? In some form or fashion those that are leaving are probably just finding  a different medium where they&amp;rsquo;re able to connect better? I actually think there are more people blogging now than before. Just in different dispersed mediums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually if we do, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be just the ebbs and flows of a social framework? People come in, people leave. You make a connection here and a connection there and hope to linger in that ether of those network connections that&amp;rsquo;s always in a flux. Also isn&amp;rsquo;t blogging a sort of &amp;rsquo;new media&amp;rsquo; when compared to postcards or aerogram? When was the last time you sent or received one?&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/06/06/letting-go/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
