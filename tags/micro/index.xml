      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a real good time at the Marine ball this year. This one felt way more &amp;lsquo;connected&amp;rsquo;. Probably because we knew almost everyone? Had to head back home around 2130 right around the time the music was kicking in. The souvenir &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/coin/#2025-msg-250th-marine-ball-coin&#34;&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt; looked pretty tame as compared to the coin the Yaoundé detachment designed earlier this year.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stopped by the Campost office earlier this Monday and bought a good ton of stamps. Added them to my digital &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/stamp/#cameroon&#34;&gt;stamp collection&lt;/a&gt;. The Post office received a fresh coat of paint last month for the Presidential election. Staff were super welcoming and were super curious as to why we were purchasing that many stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s barely anybody I know that collects stamps still. Someday maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll mail these out to someone who&amp;rsquo;s genuinely interested.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because power, greed and corruption blindsided us and we got complacent with short term profits? Beyond ridiculous that we&amp;rsquo;ve been running on layered CR band-aids almost every year making it more of a norm than an exception. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/11/07/shutdown/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the primary draw in Webmentions for me is the &amp;lsquo;context&amp;rsquo; it provides. Several years down the lane when your &amp;lsquo;rewind&amp;rsquo; brings up a post, the value that provides is quite amplified when you are able to see what/when it was written for. Totally appreciate the &amp;rsquo;nudge&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;connection&amp;rsquo; factor too. After all, the inter-web exists because of people and connections we bring in. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/27/webmentions/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic, @hund@fosstodon.org ! Thanks for the nudge! I did try Gadgetbridge a few years ago. They didn&amp;rsquo;t quite support Garmin then. Gave it a spin just now and looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way! So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been exporting my garmin to my site but nothing like a full fledged app with all the bells and whistles. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/gadget-bridge/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immich is pretty neat! It does hog /need a decent machine to run though. I briefly dabbled  installing it on an RPi3 a year ago and figured the juice wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the squeeze for what I was looking at. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty content with having all my media on a Nextcloud server where rest of my files reside. This seven year old repurposed laptop on which NC runs In tandem with Tailscale and a digital frame, serves most of my needs for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also love that subtle clink you have going on in the comment form! Pretty crafty! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/immich/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL certain watches &amp;lsquo;skip seconds&amp;rsquo; to conserve battery and to indicate that they are almost out of charge. Noticed this in my Fossil watch a few weeks ago and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother finding out why. Today, it went dead and only then did I connect the dots! Super neat! Skip a second, warn but still keep time. This is similar to a vehicle&amp;rsquo;s indicator light flashing quicker when the bulb&amp;rsquo;s blown. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/25/skipping-seconds/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;
