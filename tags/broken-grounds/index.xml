      <description>&lt;p&gt;A coffee date (read breakfast) at the Broken Grounds Cafe. Pretty tiny place with a small seating area. Food was pretty good and seemed to have quite a few vegan options. The house coffee I had was a bit on the bitter side. Should have checked before ordering. Highly likely we won&amp;rsquo;t be revisiting but definitely worth stopping by once&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
