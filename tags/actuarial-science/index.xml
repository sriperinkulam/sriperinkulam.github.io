      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all winds back to a random October afternoon in 2012. Meena and I were driving around in Chennai finishing up some printing errands when we have this discussion on students, schools and graduate programs. We were trying to figure out tier A, B and C schools for a student whom her dad was counselling and midst that discussion, I happen to mention I should apply to schools just for the heck of it. The moment freezes and she gives me the typical &amp;lsquo;Meena-look&amp;rsquo; and says - &amp;lsquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s do it!&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We drive back home and speak to her Mom and Dad to pick  their brains. Both are thrilled - to say the least. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to complete a Master&amp;rsquo;s but for a long time wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure which specialization to major in. We deliberate on how Actuarial Science is such a wonderful fit for me and why now is a good time. For the last few months we&amp;rsquo;ve been in a flux with Meena&amp;rsquo;s grad school admit, the immigrant visa situation and a slew of other things. This would only add further complications or rather - &amp;ldquo;Happy Problems&amp;rdquo; as the Bhaskars put it (and something I&amp;rsquo;ve come to really appreciate now).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That very day, we sit down to look-up universities and admission deadlines and even before I knew I&amp;rsquo;d applied to five schools - all in a span of 2-3 days. Days roll by and late February 2013 as I sit staring at coconut trees in my maternal grand-mothers house in Trivandrum the admit from Columbia creeps in. As I call and inform Meena and her parents of the admit offer, they&amp;rsquo;re electrified! I knew Columbia was a good school, really liked their electives but honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t really know that this was a great deal.  I&amp;rsquo;d received an offer from another good university a few days back but chose to go ahead with Columbia for its obvious network benefits and city-location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summer 2013, I eventually start the program and from then on - it&amp;rsquo;s been a great mix of experiences and surprises. Getting back into student-shoes after six long years has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Mottled with assignments, classes, internships, examinations, deadlines, projects, presentations and seminars - The last year and a half has been a great fire-up! Having the opportunity to meet some incredible people and take classes with some really great professors by itself was a huge learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, to me personally If my $100,000 education was any worth it, it was because of a statement that one of the professors&amp;rsquo; I really look up to kept mentioning -&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;d like you all to take from my class it&amp;rsquo;s this - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It takes years and years to earn reputation of integrity, but just a second to lose it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sounds cliché - but just to hear it from somebody who you consider a role model, mention it every semester class; totally drives home the point. And for that I&amp;rsquo;m truly thankful to everybody - family and friends who&amp;rsquo;ve been instrumental in getting me here to where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the Masters&amp;rsquo; taken care of, the next short-term career goal is to earn my fellowship credentials in the next few years. It&amp;rsquo;s a steep up-curve but I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the ride and am more than thrilled to have chosen this path. Exciting times ahead!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
