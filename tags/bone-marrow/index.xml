Back in India, about eight years ago a colleague of mine sent out out an e-mail blast to the company bulletin board checking to see if anyone was a marrow donor. His son needed a transplant and the odd&amp;rsquo;s weren&amp;rsquo;t in his favor. I had no clue what that entailed and read up a bit on it.  Later that evening as I tried registering on to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bethematch.org/&#34;&gt;Be the match&lt;/a&gt; portal, I realized they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the support framework to sign-on users outside the U.S. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take a minute for me to close the tab and get back to what I was doing. A couple weeks later I learnt the kid died and somewhere deep in my heart I regretted not trying harder to sign-up or figure a way around. But again with all things good and bad, that moment passed and I moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back a good old friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159199967110109&amp;amp;set=a.10152114894075109.905086.546630108&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater&#34;&gt;shared a post&lt;/a&gt; seeking marrow donors. I had no excuses this time around. I immediately signed up online and received the swab kit in a few days. Sent that out just before we flew to India for a short trip and late last month I received my donor card. It&amp;rsquo;s highly unlikely I&amp;rsquo;ll be called in for a match. But I&amp;rsquo;m psyched! If not anything, I&amp;rsquo;ve incremented the list of very short Indian origin donors by one. Given the lack of pro-activeness in such issues I see within the Indian society (even within my own family), there&amp;rsquo;s a long way to go. This has to change! We need more people in the pool for this to work and just cannot wait until a close family member falls sick to realize the monstrosity of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals over the next few months is to coax more of my family members to sign-up. It all starts in your home!&lt;/p&gt;
