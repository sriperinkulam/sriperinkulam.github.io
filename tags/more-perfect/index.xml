      <description>&lt;p&gt;Commerce clause, the 14th amendment and quite some over-reach&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radiolab.org/story/radiolab-presents-more-perfect-one-nation-under-money/&#34;&gt;More Perfect - One Nation, Under Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unassuming string of 16 words tucked into the Constitution grants Congress extensive power to make laws that impact the entire nation. The Commerce Clause has allowed Congress to intervene in all kinds of situations — from penalizing one man for growing too much wheat on his farm, to enforcing the end of racial segregation nationwide. That is, if the federal government can make an economic case for it. This seemingly all-powerful tool has the potential to unite the 50 states into one nation and protect the civil liberties of all. But it also challenges us to consider: when we make everything about money, what does it cost us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
