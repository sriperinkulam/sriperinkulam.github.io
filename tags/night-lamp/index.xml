      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime back S&amp;rsquo;s night light bulb fused out. I replaced it with a tiny flickering LED lamp but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t very impressed since the switch was super tiny. Went to Home depot today with her and bought a switch that she liked. Spent about half an hour together and came up with this &amp;lsquo;wireless&amp;rsquo; night lamp. She absolutely loves how it looks!&lt;/p&gt;
