      <description>&lt;p&gt;#TIL When infected with measles, the immune system takes a reboot and abruptly erases every memory of pathogen it&amp;rsquo;s had before, essentially making your body vulnerable to infections. Rebuilding immunity takes years&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in 2002, a group of Japanese scientists discovered that the receptor the measles virus binds to – a kind of molecular lock that allows it to enter the body – isn&amp;rsquo;t in the lungs, as you would expect for a respiratory virus. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12008921/&#34;&gt;cells from the immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Measles suppresses the immune system, and activates it at the same time,&amp;rdquo; says Swart. Though measles deletes immune memories, there is one exception to these losses. Oddly, the only virus you&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be able to recognise after falling sick with measles is measles itself. &lt;strong&gt;The measles paradox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/620bad720cc801.13031028&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; was a fascinating read!&lt;/p&gt;
