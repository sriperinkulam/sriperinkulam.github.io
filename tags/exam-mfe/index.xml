      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having these schizophrenic discussions.  Well, not really but yes - to that effect. The student in me babbles in dead zone while the teacher in me confounds newer variants of possible surprises. Just  15 days to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beanactuary.org/exams/preliminary/?fa=preliminary-computer-based-exams&#34;&gt;third actuarial exam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not exam-blues, definitely not butterflies in the stomach; probably what it is - is manifestation of deterministic uncertainty  as it gets closer to the 18th. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get done with this. At the same time, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get done with this. The thrill of doing well in these exams is truly rewarding. Probably something that I&amp;rsquo;d miss once I&amp;rsquo;ve earned my credentials. Something to worry about at a later point in time. For now, its back to the mocks and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/tap/itos-lemma-risk-neutral-pricing&#34; title=&#34;06 Ito’s lemma and Risk-neutral pricing&#34;&gt;Ito&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
