      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a weird feeling. To not be presence-aware of someone 24x7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, S had either been with both M and I or just M when I travel for work. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to be with just S alone for a long stretch. Until last week. M&amp;amp;I thought it might be a good idea for her to travel with me from Dubai. It felt like she matured all of a sudden during Mummyjaan&amp;rsquo;s hospitalization. Maybe she sensed the stress all around her and adapted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As S traveled with me, zipping across 6 cities, I felt I was constantly on the hook. How much buffer time do I need to get her ready? Did she use the bathroom before we head out? Did I keep a spare set of clothes with me? Will I find the food that she might like in the new place? If not, did I have enough snack options for her? Do I need to get her clothes washed in this city or the next? Which PJ set would she like tonight? How do I coax her to sleep despite all the flux around her? What am I forgetting?&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to not do that, now that she isn&amp;rsquo;t with me, It feels odd. And then, when it actually dawns that M&amp;rsquo;s doing this more or less 24x7x365 - besides the gazillion other things she does; I think the least I can do is get involved a lot more.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S celebrated her 6th today.  Unicorn themed - of course - and had her first and probably last ever PiÃ±ata. But for a mega meltdown initially she did great all through the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we signed up for a Diwali party organized by the Indian Association in Mexico. Primarily on a whim and maybe for the food? The event was last evening and boy, it was a terrible disappointment! It started late as expected. And obnoxiously loud for no reason. Not quite sure if it was the acoustics at the venue or just the MC shouting into the mic.  Maybe both? I love some good rock and metal. I love some good loud music. But I guess not all loud is the same. Also, this day and age, who even does a looping slideshow of pictures of people organizing the event? Dinner was supposed to be served by 1900. Servers said they had orders to serve only at 2030. Maybe the organizers wanted the food to be served only after the main event? When we rechecked at 2030, they said it was pushed to 2130. Had enough of it and walked out.  People were still on the dance floor and there was a good turn out. I guess this kinda boisterous social mayhem is just not my jam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head out to a Japanese (?) restaurant in Polanco since Nimi&amp;rsquo;s, Mei Mei and Manaw were all closed for service. Sushi was &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;. S did great all through the evening though despite the loud music and the crowd. That &amp;lsquo;Sticker by number&amp;rsquo; book that she received as a gift from Maddy kept her fully occupied!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning here and S is off for school. She was mildly upset that I get to stay at home while she needs to go to school. Fair world logic, I guess. We drop her and get to spend a couple hours together watching &lt;em&gt;Spenser Confidential&lt;/em&gt;. Enjoyed it all the more because we recognized quite a few locations where the movie was shot. M&amp;rsquo;s got some brunch out with the ladies in a bit and then a couple more hours before I need to pick up S. Maybe I should tweak that 3D printer?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;S just got back from a week long camping trip in &lt;a href=&#34;https://pipiol.com/&#34;&gt;Pipiol&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time she&amp;rsquo;s been away from M or me overnight and she seems to have handled it real well! Super proud of her! All credit goes to her school for prepping the class right from the very beginning of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;S had a seemingly sudden meltdown on the way back from her roller skating class asking for a &amp;lsquo;Hello Kitty Donut&amp;rsquo;. She hopped off her bike and said she won&amp;rsquo;t ride it until we got her one that very instant. M told her we could talk about it once we&amp;rsquo;re home. The looming thunder clouds didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to budge her too. M seemed to have had a word with her and that somehow changed her mind - a bit. Finally she did succumb, however vehemently showing her immense dissatisfaction by bawling and walking her bike home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M brings me up to speed once we&amp;rsquo;re home. A couple months ago, M apparently had promised her a donut the day she wore all her protecciÃ³n while skating. Today happens to be that day and in her mind S had all right to protest when we didn&amp;rsquo;t close our end of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kids got an elephant&amp;rsquo;s memory just like her Mom! While that&amp;rsquo;s a terrific thing, I&amp;rsquo;ve got work cut out for me!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This first, we wanted to take Miss S out for some good time outdoors. With various factors at play, we haven&amp;rsquo;t had that mental space to prioritize this over the last few months and this is something we definitely wanted to change this year. The Trolley trail was an easy pick since we&amp;rsquo;d already been there a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/17/number-nine-trolley-trail-hike/&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/06/14/reflections-by-the-rail-line/&#34;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We directly went to this &amp;lsquo;secret&amp;rsquo; spot that&amp;rsquo;s hidden right at the beginning of the trail. The fog and the weather made this space look even more mystical! Miss S had a terrific time hopping around and throwing pebbles stones across the stream. Later on during the drive back she went on to claim all the fog on the road was because she threw those pebbles in the water. Today was magical!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most evenings when her mom heads downstairs to the gym for a yoga class, this little munchkin and I, head over to the terrace for some &amp;lsquo;outside&amp;rsquo; time. She insists on getting her tricycle along - handlebars all donned with Christmas ornaments and the rear storage bin full of random trinkets and toys. Rarely does she really ride it.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascertaining that the Sun&amp;rsquo;s still where it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be and checking-in with the rising moon, she gets on with her daily business of running behind the crows. Time flies as she fills this unstructured play time with random activities - chasing shadows, sprinting laps, counting birds, verbal diarrhea (&lt;em&gt;What color you like? You see balloon? You like it, Appa? 5,4,2,1..run&lt;/em&gt;) and then keeping me on my toes. As the evening beach breeze sets in and the sun dusk&amp;rsquo;s down, she makes her way downstairs casually forgetting all about the bike. When she does remember it, she wants to be carried downstairs with her sitting on it.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not for Covid, we&amp;rsquo;d be out in the woods, making the best use of whatever little this city has to offer. But for now, I absolutely cherish this time outdoors with her.&lt;/p&gt;
