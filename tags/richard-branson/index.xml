      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a hard core business strategist, a budding entrepreneur, an adventure loyalist or just someone who reads books to while away time, You need to give &amp;lsquo;Losing my Virginity&amp;rsquo;-Richard Bransons autobiography a read. I picked this book &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/blog/?p=151&#34;&gt;randomly&lt;/a&gt; sometime back at a Crossword store in Pune and believe me, this is the best book I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read till date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Written in a lucid language, this close to 600 pages book would give you a wonderful insight into the interesting up-bringing of Richard, his ideology in working to set the system right, how he entered the entrepreneurial world starting off from the Student magazine, how Virgin broke ground,Â  how it organically diversified into the plethora of fields it currently operates in, hardships the group faced due to unhealthy and healthy competition, Richards take on life and adventure, insight into his world record breaking ventures and finally Virgin&amp;rsquo;s take on social responsibility. While every other page gets you smirking for one reason or the other, you&amp;rsquo;re intermittently given insight into corporal responsibility and the onus that rests on each one of us to mend the way we use natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed an incredible Autobiography!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could purchase the book online from these locations or download sections of the recordings from this page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of late, for some reason I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped reading fiction novels. &amp;lsquo;The Client&amp;rsquo; still lies in my office desk half read. I just read a page or two to keep me awake after lunch!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last week when I&amp;rsquo;d been to E-Square to watch &amp;lsquo;A righteous kill&amp;rsquo; , Rahul and I wandered into the Crossword store. Two books in particular caught my attention. &amp;lsquo;Losing my Virginity&amp;rsquo; -An autobiography of Richard Branson and &amp;lsquo;Joker in the Pack&amp;rsquo; by Ritesh Sharma and Neeraj Pahlajani. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had high respect for Richard for his attitude towards life and business, So I&amp;rsquo;d picked the book with no second thoughts. The reviews on &amp;lsquo;Joker in the pack&amp;rsquo; on the other hand were pretty interesting. I sifted through a few pages and plop it went into my cart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next day morining as I sat in the 7:45 service to PhaseII, I started reading &amp;lsquo;Joker in the pack&amp;rsquo;. Believe me! I&amp;rsquo;ve never sat glued to any book for more than fifteen minutes with full concentration. But there was definitely something in this book that made me flip the pages. A wonderfully woven story to bring about the life of a person who&amp;rsquo; made it to IIMB and his experience there. Frankly, this book has sort off changed my perception of the IIMs. The simple language and the vernacular tinge makes things much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A must read for any MBA aspirant. You can visit their website here or purchase the book online here. Worth every pie spent on it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
