      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I got a bit cocky and decided to upgrade the distro on the NextcloudPi. The upgrade seemed to go well until it threw a PHP error which got me going in circles. In hindsight, I&amp;rsquo;d setup automatic upgrades on NextcloudPi and Nextcloud, which seems to have conflicted with the actual distribution&amp;rsquo;s update. Now I did take a backup, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite sit well with the now upgraded system and the myriad PHP issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Had enough of the band-aid fixes and decided to migrate the nextcloud server to a laptop that was just lying around unused. Decided to stick with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/&#34;&gt;NexcloudPi OS&lt;/a&gt; since it has served me super awesome over the last seven years. I did make sure the auto upgrades were disabled though! Also RSync is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An added  bonus is that I now have a spare RPi3 to tinker with! Not quite &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/14/pico-de-aguila/&#34;&gt;dumbing down&lt;/a&gt;, am I?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I continue to be amazed at how hassle-free my Nextcloud setup on the RPi3 is! With automated upgrades on the NextxloudPi, I&amp;rsquo;ve barely had to login to the backend for maintenance. This has been my only file server since 2017 and the best &amp;rsquo;tech&amp;rsquo; investment so far! There&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no reason why anyone should be saving their photos/data on someone else&amp;rsquo;s machine these days!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
