      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent a good few hours yesterday and ported my garmin data over to this site &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s turned out better than my wordpress plugin and is way simpler to manage. I&amp;rsquo;ve still got quite a few tweaks to do but I&amp;rsquo;m super happy with how this has turned out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I slowly get back into running, I realized my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/05/30/owning-my-garmin-data/&#34;&gt;garmin plugin&lt;/a&gt; had a minor bug. When I built this last year, I had inadvertently hard-coded the years field in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin-stats/&#34;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; and the totals for the current year where obviously messed up. For now I&amp;rsquo;ve patched it with a quick-fix. Will have to automate it when I have a bit more time and I think I already know what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, I also chanced upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.andersle.no/posts/2018/gpxplot/gpxplot.html&#34;&gt;Anders&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; terrific &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/andersle/gpxplotter&#34;&gt;gpxplotter&lt;/a&gt;. With slight modifications I should be able to generate neat map tiles from the GPX files and incorporate it my plugin. Project for another day but I am pretty excited about this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaked this setup further to make it a bit more seamless. I used a different but more reliable script to fetch the activity json files and setup a cron job to run twice every week. Next-up: 01. Make the parsing and data display theme agnostic. 02. Add a quick link to publish individual activities as posts if required 03. Build some cool charts :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I came across this &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/garminexport/&#34;&gt;nifty python tool&lt;/a&gt; that lets you backup all your garmin data from the Garmin-Connect platform. I wrote a crude WordPress plugin to parse the json files over and display the data on my website &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/garmin-stats/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The tool is kind of unstable because it essentially &amp;lsquo;mimics&amp;rsquo; a regular Garmin-connect login and download. Also probably the reason why there aren&amp;rsquo;t many functional plugins for Garmin on wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should be reasonably straightforward to automate this with a cron job once I sort out the connection issues with Garmin. Also for now, I&amp;rsquo;m just posting all the activities to a single page. Might be interesting to create short posts for new activities and obviously filter them out from the RSS Feeds. Love these teeny tiny coding projects!&lt;/p&gt;
