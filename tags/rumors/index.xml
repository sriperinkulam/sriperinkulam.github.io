      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a month now that I&amp;rsquo;m married and I don&amp;rsquo;t even know who my wife is! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every junior who happens to talk to me asks the same question - Heard you&amp;rsquo;ve had a registered marriage! And you didn&amp;rsquo;t even tell me? All thanks to that wonderful person who&amp;rsquo;s started the rumour. And I wish I knew who that holy soul is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the rumor does any more damage, This is just to officially declare that there was no registered marriage! I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much a bachelor! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! and if you happen to trace out that virtual wife of mine please do ask her to sign the same declaration here! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
