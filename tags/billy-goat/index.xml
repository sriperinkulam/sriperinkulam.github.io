      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eyes on the Billy goat trail for a while now. With a beautiful foggy forecast, this Sunday was a great day to head to the woods.  We reached the Chesapeake and Ohio National Historic park  in about an hour&amp;rsquo;s time, only to realise that the Billy Goat section A and B trails were closed due to flooding!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having come this far, we decided to explore rest of the park. The short hike to Great Falls via the locks was insanely beautiful! So glad we decided to head this way!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/billy-on-the-potomac.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that, we head all the way down the parking lot to hike the Ford mine trail. The trail runs parallel to the C&amp;amp;O canal for about a mile or so and loops back to the parking lot crossing several streams and small waterfalls. Though not quite comparable to the BG section A hike that I had visualized, this was a pretty decent hike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This region totally calls for a revisit!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
