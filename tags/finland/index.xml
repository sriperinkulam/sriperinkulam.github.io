      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several years back when I got my scuba diving certification,  I literally had no words to describe my experience. A few years later when I chanced upon James Nestor&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/book-review/deep-freediving/&#34;&gt;Deep&lt;/a&gt; on free diving, I was shocked, mesmerized and stoked all at once. I literally gulped the book and to date it is one of those books that I could totally get absorbed in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep telling Miss Me how at times, I catch myself not breathing. While mostly it&amp;rsquo;s psychological, I also believe at some level it is sub-conscious. And then when you&amp;rsquo;re almost consumed by the mundane necessities with everyday chores, videos such as this bring your breath back - in one whole swoop.There&amp;rsquo;s so much depth in this video that keeps you wanting to re-watch it. I love the cold and freezing temperatures. I yearn for vast, untouched landscapes. And true silence gets me deeply captivated. This clip encompasses all that in so many levels all through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/182834827&#34;&gt;https://vimeo.com/182834827&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that didn&amp;rsquo;t do enough justice here&amp;rsquo;s the behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
