Took the oath this July 4th. With Miss Me&amp;rsquo;s birthday falling on the same day and the event by itself being on July 4th, this one is going to be pretty symbolic and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking deeply, I&amp;rsquo;ve let go of something I&amp;rsquo;ve been associated with for the last 30 odd years. All within a few weeks, my identity has switched (officially). It probably is going to take a few months for this to sink in. For now, its more paperwork for surrendering my Indian citizenship and securing the OCI/PIO status.&lt;/p&gt;

After a good early morning yoga workout, took the kids out for a 8 mile hike on the Skyline trail in the Fells. Half way through they were totally spent. Nevertheless, made it back to the parking lot in about 5.5 hours. This was their longest trail hike ever and I&amp;rsquo;m so proud they endured it pretty well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening, we took them out to 47 Metres down. The girls were literally sinking into their seats in fear. The boys were pretty neutral. Divs spilled a good portion of her iced coke on me. The hike was the toughest on her and I believe she was being vengeful for what I made her go through earlier in the day :).&lt;/p&gt;

A &amp;lsquo;slow&amp;rsquo; Saturday morning with the family. It&amp;rsquo;s been long that we&amp;rsquo;ve all been together and today morning was one of those days when I&amp;rsquo;m reminded how lucky we are to have such a wonderful support structure around us. A good cup of coffee, a simple breakfast and time just spent waiting for other folks in the family to wake up and join&amp;hellip;bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took the kids out to see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/project/mapparium/&#34;&gt;Mapparium&lt;/a&gt;. They absolutely loved it! This is something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite show up in the must visit lists. However, one of our good finds and highly recommended for all age groups. Also got them to walk over the Harvard bridge and then over to the MIT campus. The Alchemist never fails to mesmerize!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, There&amp;rsquo;s this deep sense of pride I get in getting these kids outdoors and off their electronic devices. Also pushes me to get more hours out than in! Works both ways I guess!&lt;/p&gt;

Got the kids out for a short 4mile orienteering session. Fit in the short 1/2 mile trail in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brooklinema.gov/1050/D-Blakeley-Hoar-Sanctuary&#34;&gt;Dr. Blakely Hoar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s right in the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humid in the higher 80s. Good recipe for some heavy showers that followed later in the evening. Hit the reservoir dirt road for a good three 1.6mile loops. Nothing like running while it&amp;rsquo;s pouring cats and dogs and you&amp;rsquo;re out there in the woods. Effectively ~9miles spent outdoors. Great way to kick off the long weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
