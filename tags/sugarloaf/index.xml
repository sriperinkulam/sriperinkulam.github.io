      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took A out for a short hike up Sugarloaf Mountain. More of a hill than a mountain! This one&amp;rsquo;s a quick 25min hike up to the summit and has some real nice views on the top. The trail generally gets super crowded but looks like the cold weather did keep the majority indoors. A got some tough love but he did enjoy the hike thoroughly!&lt;/p&gt;
