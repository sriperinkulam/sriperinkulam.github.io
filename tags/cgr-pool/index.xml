      <description>&lt;p&gt;A really inquisitive young monkey made its way to the pool area this evening. It had its fair share of fun skirting along the pool circumference and jumping in on the shallow end to &amp;lsquo;play&amp;rsquo; with the water toys and held us &amp;lsquo;hostage&amp;rsquo; for a good 20 minutes. On our way out, Shasta had a close encounter with him/her and she was supremely amazed by his eye color! One terrific evening.&lt;/p&gt;
