      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meena and my family gifted me an Odroid XU4 SBC earlier last month as a Christmas/B-day gift. One of my projects during the year-end holidays was to setup a robust home server; Essentially getting my webservers home from Digital Ocean, where they are currently hosted. This would be a terrific companion to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/11/04/fired-up/&#34;&gt;nextcloud fileserver&lt;/a&gt; that I setup earlier using a raspberry pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I chanced upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://dietpi.com/&#34;&gt;DietPi&lt;/a&gt; and decided to launch it on the eMMC chip. One of the first things I did was to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://pi-hole.net/&#34;&gt;Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;. With uBlock addons&amp;rsquo; that should be some good riddance to ads across my home network! Would be interesting to keep track of these network pings to see what devices are needlessly calling &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve ported my web applications to the Odroid board and am currently testing out the server internally before I &amp;rsquo;turn on&amp;rsquo; the traffic switch. All looks super-promising so far! Over the next few months, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to tweak the settings and tune this mini-beast a bit for performance. For now though, I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy with what it&amp;rsquo;s delivering!&lt;/p&gt;
