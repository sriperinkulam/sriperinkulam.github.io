&lt;p&gt;S wanted me to read Pinocchio out to her this afternoon. Later this night, right after she brushed her teeth, she innocently asked me if &amp;lsquo;wishing stars&amp;rsquo; were true. I of course, confirmed they did exist and that she had to patiently wait for the magic to come through. Now girl, not everything you read in books is true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long she&amp;rsquo;ll actually believe these things but I do hope to keep this awesome concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/12/26/magic/&#34;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; alive in her as much as I can.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/05/04/pinocchio/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sloshing water in your mouth, just before you go to bed, helps trigger cleansing receptors that clean your brain off nightmares. Said nobody wise and scientific. But if my five year old trusts it religiously and does it every night, it&amp;rsquo;s a lie worth telling. Just like contact lenses help see your bones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We opened gifts a couple days early this year since S&amp;rsquo;&amp;amp;A/Bonn were heading out to Merida on the 24th. Last night, S set aside cookies (that she&amp;rsquo;d baked), milk and carrots for Santa and the reindeers. Early this morning, she was beaming with joy the moment she noticed Santa had indeed taken a few cookies and carrots. As she sparkled-eye opened the Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza card game that M had packed last night as Santa&amp;rsquo;s gift, it was evident she was consumed by the &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; that was Santa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good friend mentioned couple years ago to keep the magic element alive in her for as far as possible. This morning that poignant statement flashed in my mind as I saw this 5 year old experiencing pure naive joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be naughty and be nice - You never know what gleaming rewards could come of it. Wish you a Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
