      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL Syncthing has an option to &amp;lsquo;ignore delete&amp;rsquo; in its advanced settings. Suepr neat! This simplifies posting images from the phone and lets me &amp;lsquo;declutter&amp;rsquo; the phone super fast. Likey, likey! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/21/ignore-delete/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#TIL When infected with measles, the immune system takes a reboot and abruptly erases every memory of pathogen it&amp;rsquo;s had before, essentially making your body vulnerable to infections. Rebuilding immunity takes years&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in 2002, a group of Japanese scientists discovered that the receptor the measles virus binds to â€“ a kind of molecular lock that allows it to enter the body â€“ isn&amp;rsquo;t in the lungs, as you would expect for a respiratory virus. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12008921/&#34;&gt;cells from the immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Measles suppresses the immune system, and activates it at the same time,&amp;rdquo; says Swart. Though measles deletes immune memories, there is one exception to these losses. Oddly, the only virus you&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be able to recognise after falling sick with measles is measles itself. &lt;strong&gt;The measles paradox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/620bad720cc801.13031028&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; was a fascinating read!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating! A few GPS devices apparently had a mild(?) &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ff48e143fb7f0.93623598&#34;&gt;path offset issue&lt;/a&gt; few days ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue has to do with the ephemeris data file, also called the EPO file (Extended Prediction Orbit) or Connected Predictive Ephemeris (CPE). Or simply the satellite pre-cache file. Thatâ€™s the file thatâ€™s delivered to your device on a frequent basis (usually every few days). This file is what makes your watch near-instantly find GPS satellites when you go outside. Itâ€™s basically a cheat-sheet of where the satellites are for the next few days, or up to a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this on my Forerunner 235 but I find it super intriguing to read about the &amp;lsquo;inner workings&amp;rsquo; of the background handshake. When I first got the Forerunner 235, I was amazed at how quickly it latched on to the satellites in contrast to the Forerunner 305 that I was actively using then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple decades ago when you bought a new &amp;lsquo;gadget&amp;rsquo;, you would get not only a &amp;lsquo;how-to&amp;rsquo; but also a technical sheet outlining the inner workings of the device. I miss seeing those sheets now!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Titanic possibly sank due to an optical Illusion: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/did-the-titanic-sink-because-of-an-optical-illusion-102040309/&#34;&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid I remember learning these principles with no real world tangible examples. Today as I see a plausible explanation, I&amp;rsquo;m baffled!&lt;/p&gt;
