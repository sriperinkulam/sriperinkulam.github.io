      <description>&lt;p&gt;An unplanned dine out at Coppersmith. Miss Me had bought a few raffle tickets for the Girls on the Run Boston Marathon fund raiser event. She&amp;rsquo;s coaching a team in her school and heard about the event through them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Got there pretty early and had about 2 hours to kill. Neither were into drinking and socialising so we decided to grab some food at the restaurant. Falafel sandwiches. Pretty neat! The wooden interiors, high ceilings, dim lights and Justin on the guitar totally sealed the experience. Highly likely we&amp;rsquo;ll be back here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And no raffle wins! Nevertheless, the evening out was a wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
