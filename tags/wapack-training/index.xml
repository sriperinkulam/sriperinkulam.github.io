      <description>&lt;p&gt;Miled about 16. To Harvard and back, well almost. Driving earlier in the day today Miss Me and I scouted another route for me to run. Head toward newton street, then instead of turning to the right towards south street head straight up beyond Putnam circle onto VFW parkway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bordered Allandale woods and decided to head towards the Yoga studio in Brookline. Legs felt pretty good and weather was cold and crisp with a light drizzle. Decided to go further on and hit the Boston University bridge. Boston looked so pretty tonight from Cambridge. Ran further upto Harvard and finally decided to turn around. Called Miss Me and asked for a pick up at her Studio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could have easily gone to 25 miles. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite in the mood to head back on the home stretch. Also wasn&amp;rsquo;t sufficiently fueled with liquids through the day. So decided to call it a day (night). 16 miles and a climb of 300 steps earlier in the day today at Bunker Hill Monument. One of those really good, fulfilling days!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/IMG_3889.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_3889.jpeg&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2mi to the optometrist, contact &amp;lsquo;fittings&amp;rsquo; and then 4mi back home via the &amp;lsquo;short-cut&amp;rsquo;. Listened to the Outside podcast on Joe Stone&amp;rsquo;s crash while speed flying. Spring is in and so is the warm weather. So gonna miss the freezing runs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;6 miles on the VFW loop. Good to be back on the roads. Never thought rest would be so painful. Should probably ease back in to the schedule and get some longer miles over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.5 miles around oak square. Resting out the legs. Some cold treatment and hopefully the muscles relax out over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The left shin looks to be in trouble and running seems to be stressing it further. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to take some steps back and let the body recover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A six mile short cut from CHS. Head over to the reservoir and then looped back to newton street via JD auto. No way compensates the 15mile run I had to do yesterday. New route and home by 5. Good days!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decided to make today a rest day. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s 8 miler,the shin pain and the frigid weather seem to have nuked me totally. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;m drained physically&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Painful 8 miler at Middlesex fells. Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have hit the trails this quickly. Looks like the shin needs to recover a bit more. The weather didn&amp;rsquo;t make things easier either. Super windy with temps in sub 15F. Today totally &amp;lsquo;felt&amp;rsquo; like being out there in the wild. Hopefully the weather gets better tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone chickened out and did just 4.5 miles instead of 6. Looks like this week is all downhill in terms of mileage. Regular VFW loop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A neat 7 miler to the yoga studio. Miss Me wanted to try out a new dish at Veggie galaxy. Slow but steady pace. Was so looking forward to the fries and apple cider!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
