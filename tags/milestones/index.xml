Took the oath this July 4th. With Miss Me&amp;rsquo;s birthday falling on the same day and the event by itself being on July 4th, this one is going to be pretty symbolic and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking deeply, I&amp;rsquo;ve let go of something I&amp;rsquo;ve been associated with for the last 30 odd years. All within a few weeks, my identity has switched (officially). It probably is going to take a few months for this to sink in. For now, its more paperwork for surrendering my Indian citizenship and securing the OCI/PIO status.&lt;/p&gt;
