      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ubuntu family has now doled out their latest OS - Ubuntu 8.04 code named - Hardy Heron. This release is more than different when compared to it&amp;rsquo;s previous releases. Majorly because it&amp;rsquo;s got a Wubi installer which facilitates installation directly from a Windows platform. The OS gets installed on the same partition just like any other software application, thus relieving a linux noobie from all the hassles of partitioning a drive. It can also be uninstalled just like any other app. through the Add/ Remove programs. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardy Heron is a Long term Support ( LTS ) version. The Ubuntu community release LTS versions once in every two years and I belive this version is going to be supported till 2011 ! For server editions the support is for Five years! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardy comes in with the Firefox 3 ( Still in the Late stages of Beta ), Open Office 2.40 and the GIMP (2.4.5) . Early reviews suggest the OS is pretty stable and gels with a breeze in Windows.  Ubuntu 7.04 ( Gutsy Gibbon ) literally smirked at Vista. Wonder what Hardy has in store!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any reasons why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be giving this  a shot? :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rush and download it from here !&lt;/p&gt;
