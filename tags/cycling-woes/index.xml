      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I wind up the class for the kids, I get this sudden surge of pain on the left side of my chest and a numb sensation on my left hand at about 11:55hrs. For an instant, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a heart attack. But then the logical side states that&amp;rsquo;s just not possible. I don&amp;rsquo;t drink, I don&amp;rsquo;t smoke, I&amp;rsquo;m much more active than anyone out here and haven&amp;rsquo;t yet touched 24! I let it pass off as an &amp;lsquo;out of the blue&amp;rsquo; pain and keep moving. A quick meet with a pal who&amp;rsquo;d turned up in town and I head back home by bus. All does not look OK as I manage to find a seat in the bus. Breathing turns heavier and the pain grows and then it strikes - It must be the &amp;lsquo;Glide ride&amp;rsquo;. I get down at the next stop and pick a rick to head home directly. Just as I reach home, I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed for having accepted defeat this early. I stop the driver on the road, pay him the fare and walk home instead. I&amp;rsquo;m just not able to match the pace which I usually take. A quick call to a friend to see if he&amp;rsquo;s got any known cardio doc in town. As i wait for a response, I head home have a quick lunch, fix an appointment with a doc for 17:00hrs and crash on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;16:30hrs. I wake up with the pain still lingering. Definitely a serious concern. I call up dad, Inquire where he is and ask him to tag along. We finally decide to head to AMS at vidyanagar. A quick ECG and a 2D echo state that everything is perfectly fine but for some hyper-activity. Apparently my body was revolting yesterday&amp;rsquo;s ride for some reason. Sounds weird to me because, I in fact felt much more &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/sriperinkulam/status/2454390122&#34;&gt;energetic&lt;/a&gt; when I reached home!Besides, this is not the first time I&amp;rsquo;m riding this long a distance. The doc gives me a sarcastic look and asks me to be under &amp;lsquo;observation&amp;rsquo; for a night. I instantly refute. We strike a deal that I&amp;rsquo;d stay at my friends place overnight and get back if at all the need arises. Abhi, Adi, Pavan and Praveen almost instantly drop by to see how the &amp;lsquo;patient&amp;rsquo; is faring. Sigh!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once I reach Abhi&amp;rsquo;s place I doze as if I&amp;rsquo;ve been drugged. Next day morning is just like any other day. Some pain still lingers but that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much ignorable. It&amp;rsquo;ll probably be a while before the muscles get released and I get to breathe deeply and laugh my heart out. And till then it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Playing safe&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, this weekend has sort of chalked some lines. As people get to know innumerable calls ring in giving &amp;lsquo;gyan&amp;rsquo; on why one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t cycle, how harmful pollution is, how uncanny these roads can be, how bad the traffic is. I just nod my head and cut the call. There&amp;rsquo;s just no point talking to people who&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what they&amp;rsquo;re preaching doing nothing about the situation in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay. To the point. So why did the chestburn happen at all?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I do atleast a 30kms every weekend. Last weekend was just a 10km ride. So probably the pulse was down.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Last week&amp;rsquo;s been a real busy week at work. Those &amp;lsquo;supposedly&amp;rsquo; important meeting led to me reaching home at 22:00hrs every day. Lunch for some reason was not &amp;lsquo;carb&amp;rsquo; rich and back home that late I didn&amp;rsquo;t eat real well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Okay, I agree. I pushed myself a bit hard on the return journey. Fewer breaks [Infact just two!] and very less liquid intake. [Just one glass of lemon juice and a tender coconut] may have probably aggravated things.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lessons learnt:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Watch your carbohydrate intake before any long ride. Be rich on liquids and drink frequently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Build the pulse in a slow gradient. Don&amp;rsquo;t look for a direct explosion :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Never.Never stop riding! Every sport has its negative effects. You realise things only when you experience them. People don&amp;rsquo;t make an issue of sports injury due to tennis, cricket or golf. But when it comes to cycling, it becomes a BIG issue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For others out here,things you MUST read before you decide to point fingers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deccanherald.com/content/11068/ex-army-man-cycles-against.html&#34;&gt;Ex-army man cycles against all odds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The TreeCycle initiative - Shrenik Rao&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://theroadtodelhi.wordpress.com/the-cause/&#34;&gt;The road to delhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many people out there who&amp;rsquo;re doing things much more intense, spreading a message and bringing a change. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing that you get sitting on your couch there doing mundane stuff. One life. LIVE it !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
