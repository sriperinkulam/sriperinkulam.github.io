      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decided to head to Al wadi for some Lebanese food. Was in for a pleasant surprise as we entered. I cross this restaurant almost every time I run the VFW route and never really thought it would be as &amp;lsquo;decked up&amp;rsquo; from the looks outside. Some real good choice and tasty food. Besides they also had a groupon which made it all more worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish coffee for the first time. Boy, that&amp;rsquo;s strong!&lt;/p&gt;
