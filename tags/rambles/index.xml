      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got home pretty late yesterday night after a small get together at &lt;a href=&#34;http://hyderabadjournal.wordpress.com/2008/03/22/papaji-da-dhabha/&#34; title=&#34;Where is this?&#34;&gt;Papaji da dhaba.&lt;/a&gt; No particular reason as such. Pavan had come to Hyd for a short visit post his training at Satyam- Chennai. Besides, Aditya and I are leaving for Pune this week on a short term transfer. Four of us ( Abi being the fourth) were more or less room mates all through our Engineering lyf at Kanchi. To spruce things up we had Domz joining us :-) . Doma is one hell of a person to be with! All thanks to his childish innocence! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was in no mood to sleep after getting back home. So i picked up my Guitar to try a few notes. It&amp;rsquo;s actually been quite a while that I&amp;rsquo;ve laid my hands on it. Somehow things kept me busy and getting back to the Guitar was one beautiful experience. A couple of months back while at Bangalore, I &amp;rsquo;d learnt to play KHNH&amp;rsquo;s theme song. With no practice, KHNH doles out pretty bad from my hands now but it&amp;rsquo;s only a few days before I get back to my professional level ;-) .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now there&amp;rsquo;s this Pune transfer lurking round the corner :-( !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
