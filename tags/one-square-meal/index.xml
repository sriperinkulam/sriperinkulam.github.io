      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five days back, our Bai ditched us for a few days and left for her native. Lazy bums at times that we are, Adi and I drove down to a close by restaurant for dinner. We&amp;rsquo;d heard of this place called &amp;lsquo;Rasoi Ghar&amp;rsquo; quite some time back and just thought of giving it a shot. Rasoi ghar was just a few hundred yards from the usual place where we&amp;rsquo;ve been having dinner for the past few days. So we just walked in and gave the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; All of a sudden this particular poster caught my attention. Need I say a word more? And mind you..This was just a normal shop by the roadside&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you&amp;rsquo;re on your dining table and everytime you say that &amp;lsquo;Yuck&amp;rsquo; when you taste something not so tasty hope you&amp;rsquo;ll  recollect this poster !!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hat&amp;rsquo;s off to the owner of Rasoi Ghar!&lt;/p&gt;
