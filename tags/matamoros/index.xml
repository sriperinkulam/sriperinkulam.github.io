      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back from a week long trip from Matamoros. It felt much safer this trip with a significant lack of federales presence. Until last Saturday. Locals were getting ransom calls from the cartel and we decided to operate from Brownsville instead. Otherwise a pretty uneventful yet productive trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had to wait for a good thirty minutes for the bus to shuttle us to the terminal. Not complaining one bit though. There’s a mild nip in the air. Feels SO GOOD to be back in this beautiful valley. Izta and Popo are snow capped now. So freaking beautiful. Maybe I should head out for a hike this weekend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgot my phone in the Uber on the way back from the airport. Ouch! Thankfully was able to reach the driver and he promised to get it back to me the next day. Come Friday, he said he was held up the whole day with family events but would deliver it on Saturday. Almost rescinded to the fact that I was looking at getting a new phone. He showed up as promised the next day and apologized for not making it yesterday. Super guilty of moments of fluctuating human trust…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brought home the Thinkpad 480s that I had ordered a couple weeks ago. Refurbished machine for about 320USD. Seems good so far. This along with the Samsung Soundbar that I got for 50USD from someone in the community have been my latest tech indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;amp;S are out for a birthday party and I have some good chunk of hours for myself. My digital tinker list is long but I’m not really in the mood to sit in front of the screen. A good feeling I guess? I turn the soundbar on random shuffle and work off tangible things on M’s list. Some hot glue here, a few stitches there. Each task barely takes a few minutes but so very satisfying. Time in hand and tasks not really in mind. Music in the background. I’m kinda liking this slow weekend. Looking forward to Ladek’s performance tonight!&lt;/p&gt;
