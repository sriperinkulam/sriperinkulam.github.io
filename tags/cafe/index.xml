      <description>&lt;p&gt;Out for coffee at Big Bear in Dedham. Again a family run cafe with some real interesting and tasty eats. The huge picture of a bear on one of the walls was captivating. Also, the &amp;lsquo;Caution, Bears in this area&amp;rsquo; right near the pedestrian crossing was pretty tounge-in-cheek!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just before we left, had a quick chat with the owner on a beautiful wooden slab he had designed. Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s called fractal wood burning art and is basically simulating lightning on wood to create intricate art forms. Pretty neat stuff!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
