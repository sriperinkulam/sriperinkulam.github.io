      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I got a bit cocky and decided to upgrade the distro on the NextcloudPi. The upgrade seemed to go well until it threw a PHP error which got me going in circles. In hindsight, I&amp;rsquo;d setup automatic upgrades on NextcloudPi and Nextcloud, which seems to have conflicted with the actual distribution&amp;rsquo;s update. Now I did take a backup, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite sit well with the now upgraded system and the myriad PHP issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had enough of the band-aid fixes and decided to migrate the nextcloud server to a laptop that was just lying around unused. Decided to stick with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/&#34;&gt;NexcloudPi OS&lt;/a&gt; since it has served me super awesome over the last seven years. I did make sure the auto upgrades were disabled though! Also RSync is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An added  bonus is that I now have a spare RPi3 to tinker with! Not quite &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2023/12/24/dumbing-down/&#34;&gt;dumbing down&lt;/a&gt;, am I?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ouch! After a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/06/13/maps-and-files/&#34;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/04/19/april-19-2021-2342/&#34;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; years of unhindered access, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost (remote) access to my RPI server. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing an auto upgrade might have disabled wireguard or flushed the  ip table rules. I should have had a secondary connection to the remote network since I did anticipate this happening sometime! Well, until I have physical access to the server, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to bank on my cold flash drive backups! So glad I have multiple accessible copies of the data files!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I realised the raspberry pi that hosts my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/?s=nextcloud&#34;&gt;nextcloud setup&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite latching back on to the network if the router was turned off or if the internet was sketchy. Was a pain to hard boot the device manually to reset it. Decided to write a short script to reset the network connection when it noticed something was off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
ping -c4 192.168.0.1 &amp;gt; /dev/null
if [ $? != 0 ] 
then
  echo &amp;#34;SOS..Restarting eth0 for network latch&amp;#34;
  /sbin/ifdown &amp;#39;eth0&amp;#39;
  sleep 5
  /sbin/ifup --force &amp;#39;eth0&amp;#39;
fi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chron job runs every 10 minutes to take pulse of the network, runs the above code and picks up connectivity without manual intervention!&lt;/p&gt;
