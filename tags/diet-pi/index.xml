I finally got my Shoebox server setup working! I now have three Single board Computer [SBC] working in tandem behind my home router to accomplish what I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do for quite sometime now - Setting up an easy-to-maintain, in-house server for all my data and web hosting needs. Fixing this all together has been a tremendous learning experience. I still need to weed out some pesky issues but I believe I have the bearing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my current setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/&#34;&gt;NexcloudPi&lt;/a&gt; installed on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/&#34;&gt;Raspberry pi 3B+&lt;/a&gt; board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://yunohost.org/#/&#34;&gt;Yunohost&lt;/a&gt; installed on an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4-special-price/&#34;&gt;Odroid XU4&lt;/a&gt; board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dietpi.com/&#34;&gt;Diet-Pi&lt;/a&gt; installed on another Raspberry pi 3B+ board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Nextcloud as my data storage solution for more than a year now. It does what I expect it to do and much more. NextcloudPi handles the intricate details and takes out the hassles that come with hosting data on personal servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ODroid-XU4, I installed debian stretch as the base OS and then manually installed Yunohost as my web server. I use ServerPilot on my Digital ocean servers and was looking for a close match while self hosting. Love YHs web-ui and they did seem to support quite a few web apps. I also have my eyes on &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.cozy.io/en/tutorials/selfhost-debian/&#34;&gt;cozy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://caprover.com/&#34;&gt;caprover&lt;/a&gt;. Might explore these at a later point in time if decide to switch to a different SBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both NextcloudPi and Yunohost have letsencrypt tools to setup and manage certificates for the domains/sub domains. While super useful, I realised to benefit from that feature, I had to rely on haproxy. With some &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.nextcloud.com/t/accessing-nextcloudpi-behind-haproxy/47489&#34;&gt;pointers from the Nextcloud forum&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to use another pi to front as the main server. Installed Diet-pi on it since it&amp;rsquo;s just something I really liked and configured haproxy on it to map to the corresponding server based on the hostname. While at it, I also added in a switch between the router and various servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need to work on making this more robust. One niggling issue is the speed is heavily compromised. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it&amp;rsquo;s do with my haproxy config and I should be able to fix it pretty soon. Once I have this sorted out, I need to spend some time hardening the security of the server, further configure Yunohost, device my backup strategies and finally moving my websites over from Digital Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meena and my family gifted me an Odroid XU4 SBC earlier last month as a Christmas/B-day gift. One of my projects during the year-end holidays was to setup a robust home server; Essentially getting my webservers home from Digital Ocean, where they are currently hosted. This would be a terrific companion to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/11/04/fired-up/&#34;&gt;nextcloud fileserver&lt;/a&gt; that I setup earlier using a raspberry pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/1546508775615.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I chanced upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://dietpi.com/&#34;&gt;DietPi&lt;/a&gt; and decided to launch it on the eMMC chip. One of the first things I did was to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://pi-hole.net/&#34;&gt;Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;. With uBlock addons&amp;rsquo; that should be some good riddance to ads across my home network! Would be interesting to keep track of these network pings to see what devices are needlessly calling &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve ported my web applications to the Odroid board and am currently testing out the server internally before I &amp;rsquo;turn on&amp;rsquo; the traffic switch. All looks super-promising so far! Over the next few months, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to tweak the settings and tune this mini-beast a bit for performance. For now though, I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy with what it&amp;rsquo;s delivering!&lt;/p&gt;
