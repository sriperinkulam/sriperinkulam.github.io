      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week in Malabo, I discovered that none of my self-hosted services were working. Initially, I thought it was due to my home internet connection. However, upon returning last night, I realized that wasn’t the case at all. My tiny reverse proxy, Caddy, had encountered an issue during an automated security upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I’ve adopted a hands-off approach to self-hosting, setting up auto-updates for all my services. I only intervene when something breaks. Today, I decided to give my setup a little TLC, upgrading my passthrough VPS and Odroid XU4 to Bookworm. Remarkably, the process took less than 30 minutes! Thanks to Docker and Tailscale, everything connects seamlessly and just works. Love it! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/caddy-not-caddying/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bi-yearly rundown on the state of the home-servers I run and applications I host on the cloud.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Published while listening to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=zkvNnRjIhPE&#34;&gt;Mist of Capricorn ( Manavyalakincharadate ) | Agam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/wireguard-2.drawio.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few major changes since the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/09/07/state-of-the-networks-sep-2021/&#34;&gt;last September update&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the Jan trip, I moved the Odroid XU4 and NCP over to MD. Thanks to WireGuard, I can still access these remotely super seamlessly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brought in the RPi4 NC to the same WireGuard network. Lesser maintenance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not quite using the Navidrome and Calibre-web setup as much. Definitely nice to have though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a couple &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/02/20/bridged/&#34;&gt;Matrix Bridges&lt;/a&gt;. Ansible is pretty awesome! Need to front the &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/01/25/snikket/&#34;&gt;Snikket instance&lt;/a&gt; I setup in Jan when I have the mind-space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m liking Caddy better than Traefik!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next few months, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably focus a bit more on SSH hardening, implement more robust Firewalls and automating the backups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I was able to take some time to explore a few self-hostable options. I got to explore &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/28/caddy-through-the-tunnel/&#34;&gt;caddy&lt;/a&gt; (Which is terrific by the way!), setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/15/guacamole-clientless-remote-desktop-access/&#34;&gt;guacamole&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m also absolutely loving &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/07/28/july-27-2021-2105/&#34;&gt;Navidrome&lt;/a&gt;. I got rid of OSMC since we weren&amp;rsquo;t quite using it as much and setup pi-hole to block ads network wide. With these changes, I think I am able to put these devices to real good use. While at it, I also setup a WireGuard tunnel from a VPS to access my local devices securely outside my home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Screenshot-from-2021-09-07-13-25-42.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/02/05/state-of-the-networks-feb-2021/&#34;&gt;February update&lt;/a&gt;, I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed the services on the cloud much. I did get rid of Bookstack, Known and Signal-CLI since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using them as much. I am however using &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/?s=trilium&#34;&gt;Trilium notes&lt;/a&gt; exhaustively as my go-to notes and knowledge-base application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A quick rundown on the state of the home-servers I run or applications I host on the cloud.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Published while listening to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=RlcY37n5j9M&#34;&gt;Malang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our temporary relocation, I currently manage two &amp;lsquo;home-labs&amp;rsquo; - one which I remotely manage with a WireGuard tunnel and the other just a local-access only setup. The remote home-lab is essentially a Nextcloud server running on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dietpi.com/&#34;&gt;DietPi OS&lt;/a&gt; spun on an RPi4. I pulled down the HAProxy config on the fronting server since that was no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Homelab-SoTN-Feb-2021-600x478.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local home-lab currently encompasses four units:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/&#34;&gt;NextcloudPi&lt;/a&gt; running on an RPi3 and connected to a 1TB main drive: This has been our primary document and media backup servers silently chugging along for close to three years now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://osmc.tv/&#34;&gt;OSMC&lt;/a&gt; installed on another RPi3: With a 1TB media drive, Amazon video and Youtube addons this primarily serves as a secondary family Television. A bit on the sluggish end but does the job for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DietPi running on an &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/odroid-xu4&#34;&gt;Odroid-XU4&lt;/a&gt;: Pi-Hole for Ad control and WireGuard to access the remote home-lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pop.system76.com/&#34;&gt;PoPOS&lt;/a&gt; running on an Intel NUC7: My primary workstation! An attached 1TB drive acts as the secondary backup for my NC setup and then I run sync jobs to a 256GB flash drive for a cold backup of the really important files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, on a remote VM I run a slew of services that handle most of my social and productivity tools. Fronted by Traefik and running in docker containers, the following services run on the 8GB server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bookstackapp.com/&#34;&gt;Bookstack&lt;/a&gt; – Wiki software which I am currently using to help publish my dad’s second book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://known.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;Known&lt;/a&gt; – I mostly use this as a quick bookmarking tool. I also post short updates or status notes here infrequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wallabag.it/en&#34;&gt;Wallabag&lt;/a&gt; – Read-later app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/06/14/guyon-flats-and-tuffys-tavern-trail/&#34;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt; – Way better than Instagram and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pixel.srkn.org/sriperinkulam&#34;&gt;my go-to space&lt;/a&gt; to post individual images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://selfoss.aditu.de/&#34;&gt;Minflux&lt;/a&gt; – The light-weight feed-reader that I pipe all my RSS subscriptions to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zadam/trilium&#34;&gt;Trilium Notes&lt;/a&gt; – A terrific Evernote alternative with awesome Markdown support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api&#34;&gt;Signal-CLI&lt;/a&gt; – I use this for server trigger notifications to be sent via SMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://etherpad.org/&#34;&gt;Etherpad&lt;/a&gt; – Quick, collaborative notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptpad.fr/&#34;&gt;CryptPad&lt;/a&gt; - Collaboration suite for documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calibre - I use this to manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://lib.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;my digital books collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lychee - A nifty photo gallery where I currently save my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/08/26/stamp-collection-digitized/&#34;&gt;digital stamps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WordPress – I run 4 instances of WordPress – Portals for folks in my family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nextcloud – This one’s more to test the recent releases before I deploy them on my home-lab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime down the lane I would like to setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://snikket.org/&#34;&gt;Snikket instance&lt;/a&gt; for family chats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quick rundown on the state of the home-servers I run or applications I host on the cloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &amp;lsquo;Homelab&amp;rsquo; setup has not changed much since my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/02/04/state-of-the-networks-jan-2020/&#34;&gt;last update in January&lt;/a&gt;. I did add in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/17/switched/&#34;&gt;switch&lt;/a&gt; and installed a wireguard vpn on the RPI 3B+ that fronts as a reverse proxy for the Nextcloud media devices. I also got a Seagate 2TB drive and built two partitions into it. One acts as a backup for my Nextcloud files and the other is a &amp;lsquo;cold backup&amp;rsquo; of my Hetzner cloud instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/State-of-the-Network-Jun-2020--scaled.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For personal use, I maintain two remote cloud servers on Hetzner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hetzner 01&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first server essentially handles most of my social and productivity tools. Fronted by Traefik and running in docker containers, the following services run on the 8GB server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bookstackapp.com/&#34;&gt;Bookstack&lt;/a&gt; - Wiki software which I am currently using to help publish my dad&amp;rsquo;s second book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://known.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;Known&lt;/a&gt; - FB alternative. I mostly use this as a quick bookmarking tool. I also post short updates or status notes here infrequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wordpress  - I run 4 instances of Wordpress - Portals for folks in my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wallabag.it/en&#34;&gt;Wallabag&lt;/a&gt; - Read-later app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/06/14/guyon-flats-and-tuffys-tavern-trail/&#34;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt; - My go-to space to post individual images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://selfoss.aditu.de/&#34;&gt;Selfoss&lt;/a&gt; - The light-weight feed-reader that I pipe all my RSS subscriptions to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nextcloud - This one&amp;rsquo;s more to test the recent releases before I deploy them on my homelab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zadam/trilium&#34;&gt;Trilium Notes&lt;/a&gt; - My go-to place to save quick notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api&#34;&gt;Signal-CLI&lt;/a&gt; - I use this for server trigger notifications to be sent via SMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mattermost - Slack alternative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etherpad - Quick, collaborative notes&lt;/li&gt;

<p>My &lsquo;Homelab&rsquo; setup has not changed much since my <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/02/04/state-of-the-networks-jan-2020/">last update in January</a>. I did add in a <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/17/switched/">switch</a> and installed a wireguard vpn on the RPI 3B+ that fronts as a reverse proxy for the Nextcloud media devices. I also got a Seagate 2TB drive and built two partitions into it. One acts as a backup for my Nextcloud files and the other is a &lsquo;cold backup&rsquo; of my Hetzner cloud instance.</p>

</p>
<p>For personal use, I maintain two remote cloud servers on Hetzner:</p>
<p><strong>Hetzner 01</strong>:</p>
<p>The first server essentially handles most of my social and productivity tools. Fronted by Traefik and running in docker containers, the following services run on the 8GB server:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bookstackapp.com/">Bookstack</a> - Wiki software which I am currently using to help publish my dad&rsquo;s second book</li>
<li><a href="https://known.srkn.org/">Known</a> - FB alternative. I mostly use this as a quick bookmarking tool. I also post short updates or status notes here infrequently.</li>
<li>Wordpress  - I run 4 instances of Wordpress - Portals for folks in my family.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">Wallabag</a> - Read-later app</li>
<li><a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/06/14/guyon-flats-and-tuffys-tavern-trail/">Pixelfed</a> - My go-to space to post individual images.</li>
<li><a href="https://selfoss.aditu.de/">Selfoss</a> - The light-weight feed-reader that I pipe all my RSS subscriptions to.</li>
<li>Nextcloud - This one&rsquo;s more to test the recent releases before I deploy them on my homelab.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium">Trilium Notes</a> - My go-to place to save quick notes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api">Signal-CLI</a> - I use this for server trigger notifications to be sent via SMS</li>
<li>Mattermost - Slack alternative</li>
<li>Etherpad - Quick, collaborative notes</li>
</ul>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quick rundown on the state of the home-servers I run or applications I host on the cloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I opened up my Nextcloud instance for external access. Now, since my brother&amp;rsquo;s RPi4 was already exposed on the same network, I had to setup a reverse proxy on another RPi3 to access both simultaneously behind the router. Here&amp;rsquo;s the current setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/State-of-the-Network-Jan-2020-.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proxy server:&lt;/strong&gt; An RPi3 running on Raspbian Buster Lite with HAProxy installed to handle the reverse proxy. Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/sriperinkulam/23fee95d454fe3a9ff18a0555734e3ab&#34;&gt;gist of the code&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s handling all the heavy lifting. Since SSL is handled by the other servers themselves, all I needed was a quick pass-through handshake from HAProxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server 01:&lt;/strong&gt; An RPi3 running on NextcloudPi essentially serving Nextcloud for all my file needs. Data is simultaneously backed up on a couple machines within the network. Decided against a remote backup [S3/Backblaze] for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server 02:&lt;/strong&gt; An RPi4 running on Diet-Pi and serving Pi-Hole and a Nextcloud instance. I&amp;rsquo;ve turned off DHCP on the Orbi router and delegated that to the Pi-Hole. Both the Pi-Hole and the router have static IPs assigned to the SBCs and my trusty Dell machine based on their MAC address. I&amp;rsquo;m debating if I should move the Pi-Hole over to the Proxy Server&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the home-lab, I have a droplet with DigitalOcean serving this website and a few other portals I manage. ServerPilot runs in the background on that droplet taking care of all the critical needs. I do intend to shift this over to a home-lab once I get hold of my ODroid XU4 which is currently in the Uganda shipment several thousand miles away in Chennai!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early this year, I also procured a Hetzner cloud instance to test its stability and see if I could move over certain portals to it. Should say I&amp;rsquo;m pretty impressed! Running on Debian Stretch and powered by Yunohost, I installed &lt;a href=&#34;https://pixel.srkn.org/sriperinkulam&#34;&gt;PixelFed&lt;/a&gt; and Wallabag. Installation has never been any easier! One drawback for sure is that the code-base may be a bit lagged as it gets deployed on Yunohost. Nevertheless, it&amp;rsquo;s pure magic to see things getting installed with just a few clicks and not much back-end work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, I manage a Moodle Bitnami instance running on an AWS instance. I intend to move it over to the Hetzner cloud over the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
