&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked up from the basement this early morning, I got to capture this beautiful picture of the light from the laundry room &amp;rsquo;lighting&amp;rsquo; up the lamp from the Kolam. We performed Appa&amp;rsquo;s Satabhishekam today. His sisters could attend the ceremony in person and a good bunch of family zoomed in. Until yesterday, we weren&amp;rsquo;t even sure we&amp;rsquo;d make it in time for the event. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s turning 86 this year! Several circumstances pushed this celebration until now and we&amp;rsquo;re so glad we could make it happen today. Highlight of the event was undoubtedly the veda recital at the end of the ceremony. Wish we recorded it!&lt;/p&gt;
