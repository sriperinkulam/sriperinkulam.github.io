      <description>&lt;p&gt;So thrilled to be back home in CDMX. The last four weeks have been draining to say the least. Being away from the family and having to eat outside every single day was a bit of a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the work front, each day of the last four weeks has been nothing but a regular TDY day on steroids. Was absolutely exciting to work through the never ending ‘surprises’ and finding ways to make things work with what was thrown at us. Decommissioning the existing consulate and commissioning the new one in Hermosillo has been a huge learning experience. I need to feed all that I’ve gleaned in Hermosillo into Merida’s upcoming move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I’m so looking forward to a relatively slow next couple weeks. Never thought the mundane would be so exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
