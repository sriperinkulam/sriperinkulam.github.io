Took the day off last Friday and hit the coast after the regular early morning Ashtanga class. Last years rain-check for the whale watching got us pretty lucky. Sighted around 6 to 7 whales at Stellwagen bank, 31 miles off the coast from Gloucester. A couple of them got up close (and not so personal) to the boat. These Humpbacks were pretty sober. Not much &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_surfacing_behaviour#Breaching_and_lunging&#34;&gt;breaching&lt;/a&gt;, but they did flaunt their flukes! First in-person sighting and I&amp;rsquo;m psyched. Water has always fascinated me and with the Scuba diving a &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2012/08/19/scuba-diving-pondicherry/&#34;&gt;few years back&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt to appreciate the depths a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that afternoon, spent a few hours at the Good Harbor beach. Water was much warmer than expected but pretty calm, possibly due to low tide. Hiked up a small hill right by the beach for a real nice view of the ocean. Absolutely no Greenheads. Crane beach still trumps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some delicious dinner at a friends place and we head back home. So glad I decided to take the day off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also time to add &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bluemind.life/&#34;&gt;Blue Mind&lt;/a&gt; to my reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
