&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get some miles and alts in before we head to Orizaba next weekend. Decided on climbing Pico de Aguila since it&amp;rsquo;s just an hour from home. Hit the road around 0700 towards Ajusco. Since we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite have a working toll pass, Google maps took us through some inner roads. Boy, what a ride it was! Had we not had a local bus meandering ahead of us, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure, I would have chosen a different route. Having &lt;em&gt;tope&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; on a 80 gradient uphill didn&amp;rsquo;t help either. Just thankful we made it safely to the trailhead around 0830.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment we got there, I realised this was a different spot from when I&amp;rsquo;d done this &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/14/pico-de-%C3%A1guila/&#34;&gt;hike with Mauricio&lt;/a&gt; earlier in 2024. We hit the trail soon and as expected we were huffing just a few minutes in. The trail, though well marked, was also misleading in quite a few spots. So glad I had the offline maps pulled up in AllTrails. At around 1017 we summited the peak @12,496 ft. The sky was super clear and we could get some real neat views of Iztachiuatl and Popocatepetl. Also maybe Malinche in the distance? We decide to turn around and take the same route back. After a bunch of wrong turns, we get back to the trailhead around 1200. Grab a quick bite by the quaint restaurant and make our way back to base by 1430. Great short hike with some rewarding views! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/08/pico-de-%C3%A1guila-sur/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back from a seemingly long but super-productive trip to Matamoros/Brownsville. This would be my last TDY while here in Mexico City. We went in body-heavy and it did pay-off. A good bunch of cables were pulled and cameras fixed. The weather was impeccable. With gusty winds, super dark and bearing clouds and temperatures barely hitting the 50s - It was perfect outdoor work weather. More so high up on an extended ladder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to meet the Candadai&amp;rsquo;s the day I landed. They own a property right by a beautiful irrigation canal and this place reminded me of the serene back-waters in Kerala. I totally see myself retiring in a place like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;rsquo;s offer got rescinded because of the hiring freeze. Super bummed but I guess the writing was on the wall. Well, at least there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more clarity now and we can plan our home leave together. The new administration is pushing quite a changes. I&amp;rsquo;m all for productivity and efficiency but I don&amp;rsquo;t quite think they really see or understand the scope of what they&amp;rsquo;re pushing out. With direct impacts, for now it&amp;rsquo;s a wait and act game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Matamoros TDY done, I can now shift gears at work and throttle up the check-out procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone added &lt;em&gt;Cliffs of Dover&lt;/em&gt; to the Barnyard Burger&amp;rsquo;s Jukebox. Been years that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this song! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/31/matamoros/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 21:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/19/la-malinche-hike/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I type this note, my right forefinger has a sensation I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt before. It&amp;rsquo;s mildly numb yet fully functional. M tells me later this evening maybe a nerve is probably still chilling in there. Maybe this is how frostbite feels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this morning Adam, Jacob and I head out from the cabin around 0150 towards the Malinche trailhead. M checked with some of the locals in town last evening and they mentioned most guided hikes start around 0200 to get to the peak in time for sunrise. We decided to go without a guide since the trail was straightforward and I was reasonably optimistic I could guide the group myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful 3/4 moon night and the moonlight is just sufficient to light most of our path. With temperature skirting just around freezing, Adam realizes he&amp;rsquo;s forgotten his second jacket. We head back to the cabin,grab it and get back to the trail. Around 20 minutes in, we lose the trail. Only later on our way back will we realise that this trail atleast initially switches in and out of the emergency paved route that winds up close to the summit. Thankfully we notice hikers headlamps flashing on the actual trail and bushwack our way to the correct path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my right knee in not a great condition, I&amp;rsquo;d warned the boys we&amp;rsquo;d be taking this one slow. The path is relentlessly demanding with a steady 30&amp;rsquo; gradient. We had to cover about 4500 ft. elevation gain in about 4 hrs if we wanted to catch sunrise at the summit. We take breaks as needed but keep a decent steady pace. About 1.5hrs in, Malinche reveals itself right in between the foliage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/MalincheFirstSight.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Malinche by the moonlight&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 0545, ~13862ft, it feels as if there&amp;rsquo;s a sudden cold front. We layer up as we get to the alpine zone. The scree is mostly frozen and there&amp;rsquo;s quite some ice patches on the path. Neither Adam nor Jacob had brought their gloves. I smack myself for not checking with them before we left the cabin. The three of us take turns sharing the single pair of gloves I had and truck along - one step in front of another. Slowly but surely the summit comes to our line of sight. There&amp;rsquo;re maybe about 70/80 people already trying to summit ahead of us - their headlamps glimmering in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Malinche0500.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Malinche summit about 500ft away&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around 0600 and 14108ft, we hit a narrow bottleneck with a slick ice patch slowing people down. I&amp;rsquo;m beyond concerned none of them are wearing microspikes or crampons. Well, Adam and Jacob don&amp;rsquo;t have it too. Adam mentioned his shoe didn&amp;rsquo;t have much grip either! I hand him over my microspikes and we head a bit further up. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m mentally prepared to turn around and flag this to both of them. My main concern was the cold and us not having the right gear to make our way back. With dawn kicking in, ice melt was imminent and there was no way we&amp;rsquo;d be able to safely get down. We decide to trot up a bit more and hit another bottleneck around the knife-edge that would give us direct view of the summit. About ~400 ft maybe and the summit was right there. On our turn, Adam and Jacob are able to barely make it up the pivot and I&amp;rsquo;m constantly slipping - with no microspikes. Decide to call it a day and turn around. The boys aren&amp;rsquo;t super happy with the decision but agree. On the way down we see a taste of what we&amp;rsquo;d have to endure had we continued on. But for a few minor slips we make it below the alpine range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/MalicheProxySummit.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Maliche Proxy Summit&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, this weekend, Deepa was hiking Nevado De Toluca and Jordan was doing a multi summit hike to Izta and Pico de Orizaba. We&amp;rsquo;d hear later that they had conducive conditions and were able to summit the peaks just as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/MalinchePano.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Maliche Pano&#34;  /&gt;

&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/OrizabaByDawn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Orizaba by Dawn&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make it back to the Malintzi Cabin around 0945. A quick breakfast and we make our way back to CDMX around 1400. The stay at the cabin was great and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we decided to stay overnight here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Malinche off my list now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty undecided on Orizaba. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably give it a bit more thought after the Matamoros trip.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I type this note, my right forefinger has a sensation I&rsquo;ve never felt before. It&rsquo;s mildly numb yet fully functional. M tells me later this evening maybe a nerve is probably still chilling in there. Maybe this is how frostbite feels?</p>
<p>Earlier this morning Adam, Jacob and I head out from the cabin around 0150 towards the Malinche trailhead. M checked with some of the locals in town last evening and they mentioned most guided hikes start around 0200 to get to the peak in time for sunrise. We decided to go without a guide since the trail was straightforward and I was reasonably optimistic I could guide the group myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful 3/4 moon night and the moonlight is just sufficient to light most of our path. With temperature skirting just around freezing, Adam realizes he&rsquo;s forgotten his second jacket. We head back to the cabin,grab it and get back to the trail. Around 20 minutes in, we lose the trail. Only later on our way back will we realise that this trail atleast initially switches in and out of the emergency paved route that winds up close to the summit. Thankfully we notice hikers headlamps flashing on the actual trail and bushwack our way to the correct path.</p>
<p>With my right knee in not a great condition, I&rsquo;d warned the boys we&rsquo;d be taking this one slow. The path is relentlessly demanding with a steady 30&rsquo; gradient. We had to cover about 4500 ft. elevation gain in about 4 hrs if we wanted to catch sunrise at the summit. We take breaks as needed but keep a decent steady pace. About 1.5hrs in, Malinche reveals itself right in between the foliage.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/MalincheFirstSight.jpg" alt="Malinche by the moonlight"  />
</p>
<p>At about 0545, ~13862ft, it feels as if there&rsquo;s a sudden cold front. We layer up as we get to the alpine zone. The scree is mostly frozen and there&rsquo;s quite some ice patches on the path. Neither Adam nor Jacob had brought their gloves. I smack myself for not checking with them before we left the cabin. The three of us take turns sharing the single pair of gloves I had and truck along - one step in front of another. Slowly but surely the summit comes to our line of sight. There&rsquo;re maybe about 70/80 people already trying to summit ahead of us - their headlamps glimmering in the distance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Malinche0500.jpg" alt="Malinche summit about 500ft away"  />
</p>
<p>At around 0600 and 14108ft, we hit a narrow bottleneck with a slick ice patch slowing people down. I&rsquo;m beyond concerned none of them are wearing microspikes or crampons. Well, Adam and Jacob don&rsquo;t have it too. Adam mentioned his shoe didn&rsquo;t have much grip either! I hand him over my microspikes and we head a bit further up. At this point, I&rsquo;m mentally prepared to turn around and flag this to both of them. My main concern was the cold and us not having the right gear to make our way back. With dawn kicking in, ice melt was imminent and there was no way we&rsquo;d be able to safely get down. We decide to trot up a bit more and hit another bottleneck around the knife-edge that would give us direct view of the summit. About ~400 ft maybe and the summit was right there. On our turn, Adam and Jacob are able to barely make it up the pivot and I&rsquo;m constantly slipping - with no microspikes. Decide to call it a day and turn around. The boys aren&rsquo;t super happy with the decision but agree. On the way down we see a taste of what we&rsquo;d have to endure had we continued on. But for a few minor slips we make it below the alpine range.</p>

</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this weekend, Deepa was hiking Nevado De Toluca and Jordan was doing a multi summit hike to Izta and Pico de Orizaba. We&rsquo;d hear later that they had conducive conditions and were able to summit the peaks just as planned.</p>

&lt;li&gt;Quick work trip to Monterrey. Loved that those hills are right there in the city! Next time I&amp;rsquo;m back here, I should plan to get here around a weekend. Food was great. Traffic was meh. Would strongly consider bidding for a position here - if/when one opens up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M,S &amp;amp; S went to Oaxaca. They loved it!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Girl scouts hike to Desierto Leones. Mike led the group. Was good to take a step back and be just a regular participant!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piedra Herrada Monarch butterfly trip. Barely got to spot any Monarchs. Looks like they made their way up north a bit sooner this year.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Back in Managua for a longish trip. Those wire pulls were painful but so much fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M &amp;amp; S went to Las Estacas for the Girl Scouts Camping trip. Missed being there with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We took our R&amp;amp;R in Maui for about a week. So much fun being in the water!

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/10/29/crisp-new-start/&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; goes kaput. Migrated this portal to Hugo after dabbling around a bit.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s a wrap! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/31/2024-year-end-note/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my free time over the last few days has been spent trying to implement the comments section on this site. Something that would have been super straightforward on a regular CMS is not quite so for a static site. Initially I tinkered with the idea of side-loading the comments feature over to the fediverse. It worked okay but it did feel quite choppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around a bit, I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://isso-comments.de/&#34;&gt;ISSO&lt;/a&gt; a chance. It seemed to have all the features I was looking for and was reasonably easy to setup. As with most things tech though, I had quite some difficulty tweaking it to work the way I wanted it to. Taking a break and getting back to it after a few days, did get me to approach this from a different perspective and I think it&amp;rsquo;s super close to where I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On certain things, I am perfectly okay leaving things half baked and cutting my losses. On most things though, I do like seeing things to closure. There&amp;rsquo;s so much thrill in figuring out why something is not working the way it is supposed to. Most often it&amp;rsquo;s because of something ridiculously silly or because of minor oversights. Trials and tribulations of the last mile closures, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, this site has a basic commenting system and that gives me enough momentum to pursue other things to tweak. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/12/09/last-mile-closures/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I sent out a poll to the ESC group to gauge interest in a group hike at Nevado de Toluca. There was reasonable interest and we slotted this to be a family hike on the 24th. The Padilla&amp;rsquo;s and Johnston&amp;rsquo;s had to drop off last minute. It was just going to be Hadley and the Arturo&amp;rsquo;s now with the three of us. We reached the Shuttle point around 1015, hopped in a shuttle and got to the trail-head around 1100. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to hop off the shuttle - the gasoline stench coupled with the super dusty windy roads was more than churning my tummy. S did terrific with no complaints!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around we had to pay 65 pesos/person to enter the park. Very nominal and I guess it might be to control the crowd. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen Nevado de Toluca this busy! We trot up from the campamento towards Arista de Humboldt. I compromise with S before-hand that I&amp;rsquo;d carry her on sections when I can. Boy, she is getting heavy - &lt;em&gt;big and strong&lt;/em&gt; as M would like me to phrase it. We reach the viewpoint in no time.  This place is so freaking beautiful. Even with the almost ten fold crowd than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;AristaDeHumboldt.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houss is definitely feeling the altitude ~14,060 ft. M is slowly warming up and S wants to head back to the trailhead. We decide to split the group here. The girls head over to scale one of the shorter hills on the right while the three of us head up the steepish peak on the left. In about twenty five minutes we reach to the top of this knoll and decide to turn around. At about 14,550 ft. oddly, it was way warmer than the lower elevations. A quick trot down to the rim and we decide to head back to the trail-head. The shuttle back from the trail-head is in a beaten Chevy pickup truck. We&amp;rsquo;re smothered with loads of fine dust as it zooms down the hill. S takes a mini-nap and wakes up just as we reach the car parking spot. A quick hour and a half and we&amp;rsquo;re home for a slow Sunday catch-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacalar has been on our travel list for quite sometime now. Between work travel, syncing our individual schedules and just getting around to actually booking the trip; we finally get around visiting this beautiful place this weekend in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we get off the plane, we&amp;rsquo;re immediately hit by a waft of the YucatÃ¡n humidity, soon followed by thick droplets of rain. Strikes me just then that we&amp;rsquo;re also right in the midst of the hurricane season. A quick lookup on the weather forecast reveals Hurricane Sara would be swinging past us and into the Gulf of Mexico in a bit. I slap myself on my wrist for not doing any research beforehand but also shrug this &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; oversight very quickly. How bad could it actually be? Maybe some showers here and there? We walk outside the Chetumal airport for about 500m and take a taxi from the main road to Bacalar. Oscar offers to take us there for 550 pesos. This was about 50 pesos shy of the amount the tour planner had quoted. M immediately accepts and we&amp;rsquo;re on our way. First impressions of this place immediately remind me of Trivandrum - lush green vistas with coconut trees strewn all around, narrow roads and barely any traffic. There&amp;rsquo;s construction for Tren Maya happening along the route but it barely impacts our drive. In about 50 minutes we reach the hotel and check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S immediately comments on the smell of wood as we enter our room. She&amp;rsquo;s ambivalent of the smell but seems to love the room setup. She goes around exploring the windows and shower. Once we get settled in, we head out to explore the property a bit. Hotel Carolina looks good with the woodsy feel and being right on the lagoon - but it definitely feels more commercial than I had imagined it to be. Yet another slap on the wrist. Note to self not to go by just pictures next time around. Maybe this trip planner thing is not quite working for us? This is the first time in all these years we&amp;rsquo;re using one - An embassy colleague&amp;rsquo;s wife runs a dive business and plans trips for folks across central America. We thought we&amp;rsquo;d give her a shot for this trip. Anyways, the stomach rumbles and we head over to Mango y Chile - a quaint vegan restaurant right by &lt;em&gt;Fuerte de San Filipe&lt;/em&gt; about 30 minutes walk from the hotel. The burgers and smoothies here are super delicious and we finish it off with some paletas. M&amp;rsquo;s restaurant picks barely go wrong! Back to the room and we settle down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 0730 we stir awake and quickly get ready for the day. Plan is to head over to the fort to meet out boat captain who&amp;rsquo;s supposed to take us for a two hour ride in the lagoon. M messages the tour operator to check if the plan is still on since it&amp;rsquo;s super gloomy and heavy outside. She confirms and we head over to the fort. Just as we get to the fort, the skies let loose and the Boat captain gives us news that the police have closed the port for the day. We&amp;rsquo;re obviously disappointed and decide to grab a quick bite closer to the hotel. I offer to carry S on my shoulders as we make our way back in the pouring rain. The roads are flooded and the rain isn&amp;rsquo;t showing any signs of letting go. Love this walk back and it&amp;rsquo;s been quite sometime that we&amp;rsquo;ve actually done this! Some good breakfast at Noru&amp;rsquo;s and we make our way back to the hotel. M suggests we should probably consider getting back to CDMX that afternoon. Unfortunately, there are no tickets available on the flight. With that decision made for us, we decide to head back out for lunch at &lt;em&gt;Enamora&lt;/em&gt;. Food here&amp;rsquo;s okay. As we make our way back to the hotel, the weather clears up a bit. S wanted to head to the kids pool and we nudge her to try out the swing in the water. &lt;em&gt;Sara&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; effect lingers and the water is super choppy. We try getting the kayak out for a bit but aren&amp;rsquo;t quite successful. Back to the room and we spend some good time in the portico by the hammock. After we&amp;rsquo;re back from dinner at &lt;em&gt;Noru&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt;, I nudge S to head back to the wooden pier by the lagoon. We spend some time here as the sun sets and S plays with the idea of getting the kayak out. She flips it over in an instant and wants me to get in the water instead. The water does seem way calmer and I hop in to explore the waters. This impromptu wade in was probably one of the highlight&amp;rsquo;s for the day. We head back to the room. S spends some more time on the hammock and quickly falls asleep. M and I tinker with the idea of taking the kayak out the next morning to explore the lagoon by ourselves. As I type this at 0326 on Monday, I&amp;rsquo;m actually super psyched about this plan. Hoping S is game doing this in a few hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;BacalarSwing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she is! We quickly change over in the morning and take to the waters. The weather is just right - Dark clouds hanging above and rays of sunshine creeping down. The water is much calmer and we&amp;rsquo;re near Cenote Negro in no time. We wade in the waters for about an hour and steal a few more minutes by the swing. Around 1030 we finally checkout and head to the airport after a brief breakfast stop at &lt;em&gt;Ajal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to explore the whole lagoon, I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we ended up staying for the extra day. Overall S thoroughly enjoyed the water and just lazing in the hammock. Lesson learnt though that we are best at planning our own trips and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to head to Baja California later this December!&lt;/p&gt;
