      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between M&amp;amp;S taking ill earlier this week and the shutdown/furlough drama on Wednesday, last week whizzed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined the Poth&amp;rsquo;s for a game night on Friday. S and the kids watched &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; while we played a bunch of games. Building your empire, Skyjoy, Really bad art, and that one real interesting game which we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to play&amp;hellip;2100 and had to get S to bed to be ready for the Swim meet next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnected with D. Konduru after almost 6 years. Time files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com//2021/10/07/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt; popped in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; today. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember posting about this but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I saved it in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&amp;rsquo;s down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/&#34;&gt;almost 10 year old&lt;/a&gt; hard drive before it goes kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicale.org/v3.html&#34;&gt;Radicale&lt;/a&gt; instance in my homeserver and configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davx5.com/&#34;&gt;DAVx5&lt;/a&gt; on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And just like that three-quarters of 2025 is in the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon is gearing for its Presidential elections. They go to polls on October 12th and it&amp;rsquo;s almost given that Paul Biya, who&amp;rsquo;s been in power since 1982, will be elected as the next president. He&amp;rsquo;s rocking it at 92 years. Of the 30 million populace only about 8 million are eligible to vote (20 years and older). Historically, these elections have been mired with civil unrest&amp;rsquo;s and protests. The next few weeks will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tomorrow night, if the Congress fails to  reach an agreement, we&amp;rsquo;re potentially looking at a shutdown. Beyond ridiculous that we seem to be at this juncture so frequently and living on continuing resolutions. This time around possibility of furloughs and RIFs [Reduction in Force] are highly likely. And then there&amp;rsquo;s also the drama that comes with it&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M most likely received her LNA invite. Yay! Looks like a training in December is a serious possibility. But again it&amp;rsquo;s never a given until she gets there and completes it. Adds a wrench to our planned December R&amp;amp;R and then a bigger wrench to how we handle bidding. 2026 is going to be beyond interesting. Choices, options, decisions and happy problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/29/themocracy/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went out to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://apeactionafrica.org/mefou-primate-sanctuary&#34;&gt;Mefou Primate Santuary&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Just about 45 minutes from the city, this was an easy drive with pretty decent roads. Got to see a few chimps, spot monkeys and Gorillas. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome that they&amp;rsquo;re able to provide a terrific ecosystem for these primates to recover.  For as little as 35 GBP you could &lt;a href=&#34;https://apeactionafrica.org/sponsor-an-ape&#34;&gt;sponsor an ape&lt;/a&gt;!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just about winding down from the long weekend. Last week at work was super productive but also left me pretty drained by Friday. Working in a smaller shop comes with its perks but also brings in all the logistic hurdles. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing most of it is also got to do with us being in Africa. Travel logistics are a pain and the amount of admin overhead for getting actual stuff done is beyond bonkers. Decision memos, note-verbale&amp;rsquo;s, single entry visas, travel ticketing - always something that needs to be followed up on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family back in the states decided to rent a cabin in the Catskills and get some downtime. With photos coming in all weekend, definitely missed being there. Last time we did this in &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2022/09/04/poconos-fam/&#34;&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, it was a 50 odd group and we had such a good time overall. One of those moments when you feel this is the &lt;em&gt;tax&lt;/em&gt; you end up paying for choosing this career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exited a couple family WA groups that I&amp;rsquo;d joined in June/July to manage the air-ambulance for mummyjaan. Getting people off this wretched network is such a pain. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find a decent interim - use it where absolutely necessary and GTFO as soon as the work is done. Feels like I&amp;rsquo;m beating the same drum to a deaf audience but I will &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2021/01/16/lifting-the-veil/&#34;&gt;stand my ground&lt;/a&gt; on this shit. Currently I have the app installed in my &amp;lsquo;work profile&amp;rsquo; on my personal phone and turn it on only when really necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made some decent decisions on the financial front. With some liquidity, I think we now have a game-plan for some investments. Playing the long-game does seem to be making returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took some time this weekend to upgrade my Trilium instance to the &amp;lsquo;Next&amp;rsquo; version. Upgrade was painless. Major kudos to the new bunch of folks maintaining this real neat notes software. I do need to update a bunch of my notes here. Always an ongoing process!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite a &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;, but was some good time outdoors. Last night M suggested I head out for a run the next day since the weather has been really good - overcast and quite breezy. This morning though, the sky was super clear and it felt relatively hotter than usual. Decided to still head out and so glad I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides taking all the &amp;lsquo;offshoot&amp;rsquo; roads, I also ended up doing the whole loop. On the way downhill, besides a few stares here and there, it did feel decently safe. I did consciously get my earphones off though- just to be extra aware of my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feels good to be back on the roads after a couple months. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/08/31/febe-loop/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last several days have been extremely trying on the family. Mummyjaan had a cardiac arrest on 27 June. She woke up that morning complaining of uneasiness and moving pain across her chest and back. We initially thought it was gas and I made my way to work, just as usual. S sent me an email at around 0800 mentioning the pain wasn&amp;rsquo;t subsiding and that we&amp;rsquo;d have to take her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health unit suggested we take her to the Central Hospital in Yaounde. Around 0815 she began sweating profusely and the pain only seemed to increase. Motorpool was called and we made it to the hospital in about 30 minutes. Took us about an hour to speak to the cardiologist and she confirmed it was an MI event. The hospital didn&amp;rsquo;t have a Cath lab so Thrombolysis was the next step to stabilise her. As luck would have it, the hospital did not have the block-buster drug needed to do the Thrombolysis. They mentioned the military hospital had it and the doctor was willing to come with us to get the drug. M went with the doctor since the doctor only spoke French, while we waited at the hospital. Once there,  M texted that she didn&amp;rsquo;t have the cash needed. 160k FCFA. Easy day. The hospital was generous enough to release the drug without initial payment. I head to the Military hospital to pay for the drug and the doctors in the Central Hospital started the treatment. Once I find the two nurses at the Military hospital, they walk me to the chief doctors&amp;rsquo; room that&amp;rsquo;s hidden all the way in one of the nooks of the hospital. Only there I realise, they wanted 1.6 Million FCFA and not 160k FCFA. That&amp;rsquo;s about 3000 USD and they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take credit card or USD either. I tell them I&amp;rsquo;ll have to get back with the funds and make my way out of the hospital. We barely had 500 USD equivalent FCFA in hand. The bank in the embassy was closed given it was a Friday. We reached out to as many people as we could and finally pooled enough money to cover the costs. M and I head back to the hospital handing over the wads of cash and hoping they stick to the deal. Probably the biggest sigh of relief I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a while walking away with that receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/CentralHospitalYND.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the hospital, the doctors mentioned the process was successful and she was recovering well. Not quite sure exactly when, but we glean from them that she did go into a cardiac shock after the drugs administration. Dobutamin was administered to support the heart. As we explore our next steps we realise we barely have any options left here in Cameroon. Family docs confirmed getting an Angio is the next course of action. There&amp;rsquo;s no cath lab nearby and we were nowhere confident about the post-op healthcare here. Meanwhile, over the weekend we have abysmally poor support or information from the nurses and doctors. They&amp;rsquo;re barely divulging any information and the ICU doctor apparently made the rounds but never spoke to us. We pull all possible strings we can. Jimmy Francis is able to get the President&amp;rsquo;s doctor visit the hospital and the embassy put some more pressure on the hospital to atleast give us as much information as they could. Things slowly improved a bit after this but we&amp;rsquo;re barely satisfied. The doctors seem to know their trade but there&amp;rsquo;s just so little infrastructure support. Their extremely slow pace of action and poor communication was beyond concerning. We decide to Medevac her as soon as we could mobilize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours of debating the pros and cons of medevacing her to Nairobi, Joberg, Morroco, Dubai and Chennai; we decided to get her to Dubai. It was monday evening already. The air ambulance needed 100% funds upfront and they also needed a confirmation letter from the receiving hospital that they would accept the patient. The Kuletha&amp;rsquo;s were exceptionally helpful in getting the legwork done for the Air-ambulance and the hospital admission in Dubai. Finally around 0200 on 01st July, we were able to get her medevac&amp;rsquo;d out of YaoundÃ©. Miss V and I head in the air ambulance with mummyjaan.  We make a technical stop in Nairobi and finally make it to Dubai that evening. Beyond glad, she handled the takeoffs and landings well. Once in Dubai, at Fakeeh University Hospital the moment we met and spoke to Dr. Sakib, I was convinced we were in safe hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days, under excellent observation and medical care, she recovered pretty well. On Friday, during the Angio, the doctors gave her a stent and reported the only artery that was blocked was the one that was serving the heart. We&amp;rsquo;d probably be looking at locomotive or cognitive impairment had it been somewhere else! So unluckily lucky! What a coincidence that she got her stent done on M&amp;rsquo;s birthday in the city that M was born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that bullet thwarted, I think we&amp;rsquo;d be remiss if we didn&amp;rsquo;t take some actionable steps. Need to get those baseline health checks in place. We&amp;rsquo;re going to stall anybody from visiting us until they have a Medevac insurance sorted out. I need to plan for more liquidity in my emergency funds given how cash-dependent this country is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has probably been the most stressful thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me in a while. Even when Amma was sick, I think I knew what to expect. We were sort of in a Catch22 situation here. The medical facilities weren&amp;rsquo;t quite kitted to handle cardiac issues and we had to stabilise her before we could even consider medevacing her for further care. Thankfully we had doctors in the family who were able to provide remote assistance and guided us with questions to ask. But for those vital family and friend connections, this could have ended up way differently&amp;hellip;So many things to be grateful for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get some miles and alts in before we head to Orizaba next weekend. Decided on climbing Pico de Aguila since it&amp;rsquo;s just an hour from home. Hit the road around 0700 towards Ajusco. Since we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite have a working toll pass, Google maps took us through some inner roads. Boy, what a ride it was! Had we not had a local bus meandering ahead of us, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure, I would have chosen a different route. Having &lt;em&gt;tope&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; on a 80 gradient uphill didn&amp;rsquo;t help either. Just thankful we made it safely to the trailhead around 0830.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment we got there, I realised this was a different spot from when I&amp;rsquo;d done this &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/04/14/pico-de-%C3%A1guila/&#34;&gt;hike with Mauricio&lt;/a&gt; earlier in 2024. We hit the trail soon and as expected we were huffing just a few minutes in. The trail, though well marked, was also misleading in quite a few spots. So glad I had the offline maps pulled up in AllTrails. At around 1017 we summited the peak @12,496 ft. The sky was super clear and we could get some real neat views of Iztachiuatl and Popocatepetl. Also maybe Malinche in the distance? We decide to turn around and take the same route back. After a bunch of wrong turns, we get back to the trailhead around 1200. Grab a quick bite by the quaint restaurant and make our way back to base by 1430. Great short hike with some rewarding views! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/02/08/pico-de-%C3%A1guila-sur/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back from a seemingly long but super-productive trip to Matamoros/Brownsville. This would be my last TDY while here in Mexico City. We went in body-heavy and it did pay-off. A good bunch of cables were pulled and cameras fixed. The weather was impeccable. With gusty winds, super dark and bearing clouds and temperatures barely hitting the 50s - It was perfect outdoor work weather. More so high up on an extended ladder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to meet the Candadai&amp;rsquo;s the day I landed. They own a property right by a beautiful irrigation canal and this place reminded me of the serene back-waters in Kerala. I totally see myself retiring in a place like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;rsquo;s offer got rescinded because of the hiring freeze. Super bummed but I guess the writing was on the wall. Well, at least there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more clarity now and we can plan our home leave together. The new administration is pushing quite a changes. I&amp;rsquo;m all for productivity and efficiency but I don&amp;rsquo;t quite think they really see or understand the scope of what they&amp;rsquo;re pushing out. With direct impacts, for now it&amp;rsquo;s a wait and act game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Matamoros TDY done, I can now shift gears at work and throttle up the check-out procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone added &lt;em&gt;Cliffs of Dover&lt;/em&gt; to the Barnyard Burger&amp;rsquo;s Jukebox. Been years that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this song! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/01/31/matamoros/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;
