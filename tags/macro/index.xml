Tom&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gagor.pro/2025/11/generating-miniatures-for-my-frameo-digital-photo-frame/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; nudged me to revive my Digital photo frame that I set up &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/05/23/digital-photo-frame/&#34;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. Turned it on this morning and it lit up like it was setup a minute ago. Love it! Took me a minute though to figure out how I&amp;rsquo;d initially set it up since I missed documenting it then. So here&amp;rsquo;s a quick note for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display: 15.6&amp;quot; Portable Display by Arzopa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frame: A spare Ikea frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SBC Board: A repurposed Raspberry Pi 3 from that snazzy &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/11/04/fired-up/&#34;&gt;Nextcloud Box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thumb-drive for photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black Duct-tape!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leaned on the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://dietpi.com/&#34;&gt;DietPi OS&lt;/a&gt; for the base operating system. Once the system boots up a script runs &lt;a href=&#34;https://feh.finalrewind.org/&#34;&gt;FEH&lt;/a&gt; to display photos from the thumb-drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#! /bin/sh
cd /mnt/photos
feh -Z -z -F -D 60 --hide-pointer --auto-rotate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially FEH picks up photos from the thumbdrive, random sorts them and displays a properly zoomed and oriented image every minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choosing-images&#34;&gt;Choosing images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently manage my photo collection by syncing them into my Nextcloud server sorted by year, month and occasion. At the end of every month, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digikam.org/&#34;&gt;Digikam&lt;/a&gt; to tag and export photos like-so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All photos are tagged by their month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then photos that I want to display on the screen are tagged as &amp;lsquo;Arzopa&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A saved search query exports these to the Thumbdrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this a manual process forces me to take a step back and actually choose what gets displayed on the screen besides giving me another opportunity to go back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup scripts to turn off/on the screen based on the environment or time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable touchscreen or button options to pause and navigate photos on demand.

&lt;p&gt;Why does it feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing the same story multiple times over the last three days? Because, maybe I actually did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote something to that effect earlier today to one of the teams I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to resolve an ongoing issue with. They are a good bunch of folks. But there seems to be a disconnect somewhere that&amp;rsquo;s causing needless delays in what I&amp;rsquo;d like to get done. I feel issues fail to get resolved mostly because of lack of proper communication during their shift handovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes after I sent that note, somewhere it also hit me real hard. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really have sent that note? It does not benefit anybody but just my restless self. Adds nothing positive to the situation and if anything effectively brings the relationship a few steps backwards. Super frustrating when you see both sides of the coin and still need to get shit done&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/11/14/handover/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reorganized my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2020/05/07/migrating-over-to-trilium-notes/&#34;&gt;Trilium Notes&lt;/a&gt; a bit. Over time I started dumping notes in there and somewhere it all went a bit wayward. I really need to start using it as a proper knowledge base. The good thing is &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; content that I refer to frequently is all in there. This along with my Signal &amp;lsquo;Note-to-self&amp;rsquo; are my go-to spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to read more blogs that are not tech related. Mostly driven by my curiosity in the tech space, I&amp;rsquo;ve somehow gotten into this bubble of tech-adjacent blogs. Would be nice to pop out a bit. Maybe I should explore &lt;a href=&#34;https://powrss.com/&#34;&gt;powRSS&lt;/a&gt; a bit? I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed I lean towards people who have their own personal domain. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of some sort of commitment towards actually owning their writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking if I want to get a nice digital sketch book. Or I should just re-purpose that old kindle? There are times I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to &amp;lsquo;write&amp;rsquo;. Some things are probably better just sketched out. I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.secuso.privacyfriendlysketching/&#34;&gt;Sketches&lt;/a&gt;
app before. Maybe i&amp;rsquo;ll just port that over to the kindle one of these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google seems to be making all moves to prevent sideloading apps in Android. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time I shift gears and look at other alternatives out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zen-browser.app/&#34;&gt;Zen browser&lt;/a&gt; looks real neat. Should give it a spin one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a mildly thawed frozen Papaya&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/29/all-over-the-place/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week in Malabo, I discovered that none of my self-hosted services were working. Initially, I thought it was due to my home internet connection. However, upon returning last night, I realized that wasn’t the case at all. My tiny reverse proxy, Caddy, had encountered an issue during an automated security upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I’ve adopted a hands-off approach to self-hosting, setting up auto-updates for all my services. I only intervene when something breaks. Today, I decided to give my setup a little TLC, upgrading my passthrough VPS and Odroid XU4 to Bookworm. Remarkably, the process took less than 30 minutes! Thanks to Docker and Tailscale, everything connects seamlessly and just works. Love it! &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/26/caddy-not-caddying/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s friday night and Magno has their regular DJ blasting music downstairs by the restaurant. My room is right above the restaurant and there&amp;rsquo;s zero sound proofing. I plug my earphones in and turn on the noise cancellation. Works just as it is supposed to.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long few days. I&amp;rsquo;ll maybe listen to a podcast and fall asleep. Maybe read some?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sifting through my blogroll I land on &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/68fe2d14911b63.94312147&#34;&gt;Every mother visits but mine&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://azan-n.com/library/&#34;&gt;Azan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pineappleexpressmusic.bandcamp.com/track/find-you&#34;&gt;Finding you&lt;/a&gt; starts playing from my playlist. And from nowhere all memories of amma flash in my mind. Tears well up my eyes. I hold them back and pause the music. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help though. The post and the music maybe triggered those emotions? Or was it me thinking about her earlier this week during Diwali? Memories flash forward and backward like an old photo reel. I read somewhere memories are fickle. Each time you recollect something, it&amp;rsquo;s a variant of the actual. Your mind alters the recall very so finely that over time, your recall and what actually happened are way different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want that to happen. Memories are all I have of her.  And I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have any pictures of just her and me. I want to remember things the way they were at that moment. This is probably why I write about these fleeting moments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your close ones pass away, you don&amp;rsquo;t really miss them that very moment. You miss them at random moments and it whacks you real hard every single time. You&amp;rsquo;d think over time it&amp;rsquo;ll pass. But it fucking never does. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/24/missing/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between M&amp;amp;S taking ill earlier this week and the shutdown/furlough drama on Wednesday, last week whizzed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined the Poth&amp;rsquo;s for a game night on Friday. S and the kids watched &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt; while we played a bunch of games. Building your empire, Skyjoy, Really bad art, and that one real interesting game which we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to play&amp;hellip;2100 and had to get S to bed to be ready for the Swim meet next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnected with D. Konduru after almost 6 years. Time files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com//2021/10/07/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell people anything&lt;/a&gt; popped in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/rewind&#34;&gt;Rewind&lt;/a&gt; today. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember posting about this but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I saved it in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/615ecfe806c639.34280359&#34;&gt;wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&amp;rsquo;s down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&amp;rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/&#34;&gt;almost 10 year old&lt;/a&gt; hard drive before it goes kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicale.org/v3.html&#34;&gt;Radicale&lt;/a&gt; instance in my homeserver and configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davx5.com/&#34;&gt;DAVx5&lt;/a&gt; on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

HabitatChronicles seems to be having a database issue and the site&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>S has gotten into rainbow looms. Keeps her quite busy but also generates A LOT of loom bracelets and rings.</p>
<p>Have had barely any time to tinker with stuff this weekend. S&rsquo;s swim meet sucked most of Saturday and M was out almost all of Sunday for various things.</p>
<p>Prepped the two SSDs that I bought earlier this week. Should RSYNC backup my data files from the now <a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2024/11/29/2024-11-29/">almost 10 year old</a> hard drive before it goes kaput.</p>
<p>Setup a <a href="https://radicale.org/v3.html">Radicale</a> instance in my homeserver and configured <a href="https://www.davx5.com/">DAVx5</a> on my phone to tidy up all my contacts and calendars. While at it, I also installed and setup the FOSS Calendar app as the primary calendar app on my phone. Super slick and tidy! Should have made this switch way before&hellip;<a href="https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/10/05/radicale/" style="text-decoration: none !important;">🔗</a>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And just like that three-quarters of 2025 is in the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameroon is gearing for its Presidential elections. They go to polls on October 12th and it&amp;rsquo;s almost given that Paul Biya, who&amp;rsquo;s been in power since 1982, will be elected as the next president. He&amp;rsquo;s rocking it at 92 years. Of the 30 million populace only about 8 million are eligible to vote (20 years and older). Historically, these elections have been mired with civil unrest&amp;rsquo;s and protests. The next few weeks will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tomorrow night, if the Congress fails to  reach an agreement, we&amp;rsquo;re potentially looking at a shutdown. Beyond ridiculous that we seem to be at this juncture so frequently and living on continuing resolutions. This time around possibility of furloughs and RIFs [Reduction in Force] are highly likely. And then there&amp;rsquo;s also the drama that comes with it&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M most likely received her LNA invite. Yay! Looks like a training in December is a serious possibility. But again it&amp;rsquo;s never a given until she gets there and completes it. Adds a wrench to our planned December R&amp;amp;R and then a bigger wrench to how we handle bidding. 2026 is going to be beyond interesting. Choices, options, decisions and happy problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2025/09/29/themocracy/&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none !important;&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went out to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://apeactionafrica.org/mefou-primate-sanctuary&#34;&gt;Mefou Primate Santuary&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Just about 45 minutes from the city, this was an easy drive with pretty decent roads. Got to see a few chimps, spot monkeys and Gorillas. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome that they&amp;rsquo;re able to provide a terrific ecosystem for these primates to recover.  For as little as 35 GBP you could &lt;a href=&#34;https://apeactionafrica.org/sponsor-an-ape&#34;&gt;sponsor an ape&lt;/a&gt;!
