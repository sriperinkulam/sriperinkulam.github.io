Rest in peace, little one. I’ll remember your glowing eyes and sheepish grin as you won me in your empire. I’ll remember you delicately handling your food when you came over to our place for dinner. I’ll remember you sitting by the side of the emb pool slowly contemplating if you wanted to get in or not. I’ll remember you running all over your yard behind those bunnies.

So here’s a quick note for posterity.

Wrote something to that effect earlier today to one of the teams I’ve been trying to resolve an ongoing issue with. They are a good bunch of folks. But there seems to be a disconnect somewhere that’s causing needless delays in what I’d like to get done. I feel issues fail to get resolved mostly because of lack of proper communication during their shift handovers.

The good thing is most content that I refer to frequently is all in there. This along with my Signal ‘Note-to-self’ are my go-to spaces.
I’d like to read more blogs that are not tech related. Mostly driven by my curiosity in the tech space, I’ve somehow gotten into this bubble of tech-adjacent blogs. Would be nice to pop out a bit. Maybe I should explore powRSS a bit? I’ve also noticed I lean towards people who have their own personal domain. Maybe it’s a sign of some sort of commitment towards actually owning their writing?

Initially, I thought it was due to my home internet connection. However, upon returning last night, I realized that wasn’t the case at all. My tiny reverse proxy, Caddy, had encountered an issue during an automated security upgrade.
Over the past few years, I’ve adopted a hands-off approach to self-hosting, setting up auto-updates for all my services. I only intervene when something breaks. Today, I decided to give my setup a little TLC, upgrading my passthrough VPS and Odroid XU4 to Bookworm. Remarkably, the process took less than 30 minutes!

I’ll maybe listen to a podcast and fall asleep. Maybe read some?
Sifting through my blogroll I land on Every mother visits but mine via Azan. Finding you starts playing from my playlist. And from nowhere all memories of amma flash in my mind. Tears well up my eyes. I hold them back and pause the music. Doesn’t really help though. The post and the music maybe triggered those emotions? Or was it me thinking about her earlier this week during Diwali? Memories flash forward and backward like an old photo reel. I read somewhere memories are fickle. Each time you recollect something, it’s a variant of the actual. Your mind alters the recall very so finely that over time, your recall and what actually happened are way different.

He’s rocking it at 92 years. Of the 30 million populace only about 8 million are eligible to vote (20 years and older). Historically, these elections have been mired with civil unrest’s and protests.
