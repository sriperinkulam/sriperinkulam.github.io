Sur</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>I wanted to get some miles and alts in before we head to Orizaba next weekend. Decided on climbing Pico de Aguila since it’s just an hour from home. Hit the road around 0700 towards Ajusco. Since we didn’t quite have a working toll pass, Google maps took us through some inner roads. Boy, what a ride it was! Had we not had a local bus meandering ahead of us, I’m pretty sure, I would have chosen a different route. Having tope’s on a 80 gradient uphill didn’t help either. Just thankful we made it safely to the trailhead around 0830.

This would be my last TDY while here in Mexico City. We went in body-heavy and it did pay-off. A good bunch of cables were pulled and cameras fixed. The weather was impeccable. With gusty winds, super dark and bearing clouds and temperatures barely hitting the 50s - It was perfect outdoor work weather. More so high up on an extended ladder!

Earlier this morning Adam, Jacob and I head out from the cabin around 0150 towards the Malinche trailhead. M checked with some of the locals in town last evening and they mentioned most guided hikes start around 0200 to get to the peak in time for sunrise. We decided to go without a guide since the trail was straightforward and I was reasonably optimistic I could guide the group myself.

Quick work trip to Monterrey. Loved that those hills are right there in the city! Next time I’m back here, I should plan to get here around a weekend. Food was great. Traffic was meh. Would strongly consider bidding for a position here - if/when one opens up! M,S & S went to Oaxaca. They loved it! FEB Work travels took me to Merida and Managua. Managua had the vibes of any second tier southern Indian city. Anton’s Whiskey tasting was uber fun! Girl scouts hike to Desierto Leones. Mike led the group. Was good to take a step back and be just a regular participant! Piedra Herrada Monarch butterfly trip. Barely got to spot any Monarchs. Looks like they made their way up north a bit sooner this year. MAR Aparna and Vuday visit us for a few days. Joined them on the hot air balloon up the Teotihuacan Pyramids. Such a cool experience! Back in Managua for a longish trip. Those wire pulls were painful but so much fun! M & S went to Las Estacas for the Girl Scouts Camping trip. Missed being there with them. We took our R&amp;R in Maui for about a week. So much fun being in the water! But boy, oh so pricey! Haleakala was neat. Missed the whales though! APR Hallucinations up on the Izta were surreal. Family visited Cancun. We took a rain-check. Just didn’t make financial sense. Jothi patti and the Wierer’s visited us for a week. The Nevado de toluca hike would probably be one of the highlights of our Mexico posting! Hiked up Pico de aguila cerro cruz. The descent was - oh so painful - but super fun! Work trip to Hermosillo. MAY Yet another epic Bourbon tasting evening. M took a salsa making class and she said she loved it! A quick whirlwind trip to NJ, NY, MD for Rohita’s wedding. S went for a weeklong school trip to Pipiol. We’d see the effects of it over the next few weeks… Managed to fit in a NextcloudPi migration and setup the Digital Frame. Work took me back to Monterrey for a short project and then to Merida for a routine visit. Good bunch of travel this month. JUN Appa, Manni and Miss Bama whip out a super successful India trip. M,S and I went to a Blue Man Group performance. Jinesh & Soony visit us in CDMX for a few days. Tinkered a bit with Tasmota and HomeAssistant to setup a few smart-plugs.

Something that would have been super straightforward on a regular CMS is not quite so for a static site. Initially I tinkered with the idea of side-loading the comments feature over to the fediverse. It worked okay but it did feel quite choppy.
Looking around a bit, I decided to give ISSO a chance. It seemed to have all the features I was looking for and was reasonably easy to setup. As with most things tech though, I had quite some difficulty tweaking it to work the way I wanted it to. Taking a break and getting back to it after a few days, did get me to approach this from a different perspective and I think it’s super close to where I’d like it to be.

There was reasonable interest and we slotted this to be a family hike on the 24th. The Padilla’s and Johnston’s had to drop off last minute. It was just going to be Hadley and the Arturo’s now with the three of us. We reached the Shuttle point around 1015, hopped in a shuttle and got to the trail-head around 1100. Couldn’t wait to hop off the shuttle - the gasoline stench coupled with the super dusty windy roads was more than churning my tummy. S did terrific with no complaints!

Between work travel, syncing our individual schedules and just getting around to actually booking the trip; we finally get around visiting this beautiful place this weekend in November.
As we get off the plane, we’re immediately hit by a waft of the Yucatán humidity, soon followed by thick droplets of rain. Strikes me just then that we’re also right in the midst of the hurricane season. A quick lookup on the weather forecast reveals Hurricane Sara would be swinging past us and into the Gulf of Mexico in a bit. I slap myself on my wrist for not doing any research beforehand but also shrug this minor oversight very quickly. How bad could it actually be? Maybe some showers here and there? We walk outside the Chetumal airport for about 500m and take a taxi from the main road to Bacalar. Oscar offers to take us there for 550 pesos. This was about 50 pesos shy of the amount the tour planner had quoted. M immediately accepts and we’re on our way. First impressions of this place immediately remind me of Trivandrum - lush green vistas with coconut trees strewn all around, narrow roads and barely any traffic. There’s construction for Tren Maya happening along the route but it barely impacts our drive. In about 50 minutes we reach the hotel and check-in.
