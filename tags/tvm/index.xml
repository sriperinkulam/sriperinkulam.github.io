      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get into my house, I believe from the side entrance. Looks like there&amp;rsquo;s nobody in there. It&amp;rsquo;s mildly windy. Possibly from an open window? There&amp;rsquo;s a barely audible calming music from MS coming out from the bedroom. As I walk in, I notice TVM in the bed cocooned in a blanket, her eye&amp;rsquo;s glazed and probing deep in thought. I gently tap her and ask her if everything&amp;rsquo;s okay. She turns around and I somehow know she&amp;rsquo;s thinking of Amma. Tears well up in her eyes as she asks if we did everything we could. I&amp;rsquo;m petrified. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an answer for her and I&amp;rsquo;m left standing there for a seemingly long time&amp;hellip; All of a sudden I notice someone trying to open the window mesh and get the keys from the inside. Atchuth? I open the main door and see Nikhil, Sharath, Aparna and a few other kids. They say they&amp;rsquo;re back from Brueggers. I come back to the bedroom to check on TVM. She&amp;rsquo;s smiling as if nothing in the past really happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wait. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense. There&amp;rsquo;s no Brueggers in Habsiguda. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a Brueggers myself. This can&amp;rsquo;t be real. I turn around and realize it&amp;rsquo;s 04:40am. Hop off the bed, into my yoga clothes and head to the kitchen. I&amp;rsquo;m insanely awake and fresh. As I work on different tasks in the kitchen the dream keeps playing in my mind&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Miss Me has long been saying I should write more about Amma. Unfortunately, most of my memories now only seem to be from her last few years in the hospital. Times mostly dabbled with pain&amp;hellip;I barely recollect any memories of me growing up with her around. Memories need triggers and someday hopefully when they kick in, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to recollect more of the good times I spent with her&amp;hellip;If only I could get those back, I&amp;rsquo;d treasure them for life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/cropped-cropped-SP01-550afdebv1_site_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com&#34;&gt;Srikanth Perinkulam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
