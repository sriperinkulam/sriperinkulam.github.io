      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most repulsive moment of the day yesterday was to pay 40x for an RT-PCR test - as compared to the test I&amp;rsquo;d taken just a few days ago. So repulsive that I fumingly shred the papers in tiny bits and walked out of the queue just looking at that number and knowing fairly well I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite have any other options&amp;hellip;only to rejoin the queue half an hour later since guess what? - I&amp;rsquo;d absolutely no other options. Sucked big-time and now I&amp;rsquo;d also wasted a few more hours of precious time with family. Pandemic travel tales, I guess. The looming snow storms better not mess this up further!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
