      <description>&lt;p&gt;First ashtanga class at Down Under Yoga and it felt SO FREAKING GOOD! Started off with a short chant and dived straight into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jasonyoga.com/wp-content/uploads/sun_salutes_A_breaths.jpg&#34;&gt;Sun Salutations A&lt;/a&gt;. The first few rounds felt pretty straight forward. But then pretty quickly I found it really hard to keep track of my breathing and the sequence. I was asked to watch as Meena and another fogi (fellow yogi) moved over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jasonyoga.com/wp-content/uploads/Suns_B_minimal_names_510.jpg&#34;&gt;Sun Salutations B&lt;/a&gt;. After they practiced that for a bit, We moved over to the lotus position. Some good shoulder stretch and body holds (names of which I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember now!) and we closed out the session with a long &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavasana&#34;&gt;Shavasana&lt;/a&gt;. The heat in the room and the consistent nasal breathing had me sweating loads by the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m consciously working on improving my breathing and working on my core and with this brief exposure to Ashtanga, I&amp;rsquo;m psyched about its tremendous benefits. With mandated early AM classes at least thrice a week, It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a huge time commitment. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be an interesting few weeks initially as we try and work out our new schedule. Truly excited to see this through!&lt;/p&gt;
