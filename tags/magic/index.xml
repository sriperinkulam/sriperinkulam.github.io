      <description>&lt;p&gt;We opened gifts a couple days early this year since S&amp;rsquo;&amp;amp;A/Bonn were heading out to Merida on the 24th. Last night, S set aside cookies (that she&amp;rsquo;d baked), milk and carrots for Santa and the reindeers. Early this morning, she was beaming with joy the moment she noticed Santa had indeed taken a few cookies and carrots. As she sparkled-eye opened the Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza card game that M had packed last night as Santa&amp;rsquo;s gift, it was evident she was consumed by the &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; that was Santa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very good friend mentioned couple years ago to keep the magic element alive in her for as far as possible. This morning that poignant statement flashed in my mind as I saw this 5 year old experiencing pure naive joy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be naughty and be nice - You never know what gleaming rewards could come of it. Wish you a Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
