      <description>&lt;p&gt;Makes me wonder if we as humans, were engineered by another intelligent form as a version of an AI, to create a smarter generation of AI. And if this really is a cascading iteration, which neural node are we in? Drawing a parallel, the current &amp;lsquo;generation&amp;rsquo; of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t probably &amp;lsquo;aware&amp;rsquo; of the existence of us humans and are currently evolving in a &amp;lsquo;universe&amp;rsquo; of their own and self engineering themselves based on their own feedback loops. We probably will never truly understand how and what they&amp;rsquo;ll evolve to. Or as Dennett says, unless a system can explain its actions better than we humans, it should not be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, a strange self-driving car was released onto the quiet roads of Monmouth County, New Jersey. The experimental vehicle, developed by researchers at the chip maker Nvidia, didn’t look different from other autonomous cars, but it was unlike anything demonstrated by Google, Tesla, or General Motors, and it showed the rising power of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
