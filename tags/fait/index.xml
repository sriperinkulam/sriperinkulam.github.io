      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse of the past week and the few articles, podcasts, tools, videos and music that captivated my attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks have been pretty &amp;lsquo;choppy&amp;rsquo;. Some recent developments on the work front has gotten us back to Boston. Always wonderful being back here. Looks like New-England has had a pretty mild winter and we&amp;rsquo;re making sure we take Shasta out as much as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple weeks we&amp;rsquo;ll have to make a few interesting decisions. Between grad programs, fellowships and other exciting opportunities; 2020 is already off to a happening start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tax filing time! I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ec4320d980f38.10621582&#34;&gt;super pissed with TurboTax last year&lt;/a&gt;. This year I helped file taxes for my in-laws using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freefilefillableforms.com/&#34;&gt;FreeFillableForms&lt;/a&gt; option. Found it to be super easy and straight forward. Will most likely use it for my personal taxes too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting podcasts this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://darknetdiaries.com/&#34;&gt;Darknet Diaries&lt;/a&gt;: Chanced upon this podcast early this week while sifting through AntennaPod and the premise sounded pretty interesting - Hacking and cyber-warfare. My podcast consumption has drastically come down over the last few months. This will hopefully get me back on the podtrack!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting tools this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://minetime.ai/&#34;&gt;MineTime&lt;/a&gt; : Think &amp;lsquo;smarter&amp;rsquo; calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digikam.org/&#34;&gt;Digikam&lt;/a&gt; : Self hosted photo management with facial recognition! I&amp;rsquo;d probably pair this with my Nextcloud photo library over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting reads this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ee9d823b05bf0.76779254&#34;&gt;Lifesaving rescue on Mount Washington&lt;/a&gt;: Yet another terrific read from Ty Gagne! Note to self to get that &lt;a href=&#34;https://wildlife.state.nh.us/safe/&#34;&gt;HikeSafe card&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/eDqTtT&#34;&gt;Talking to youth about privacy, security and digital spaces&lt;/a&gt;: Wonderful piece, Ian. Loved the concept of identifying an &amp;lsquo;approach point&amp;rsquo;. Most of what he mentioned also applies to adults and more so elderly parents who&amp;rsquo;ve jumped on the digital scene without much awareness on the privacy implications!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/ustEXp&#34;&gt;The medications that change who we are&lt;/a&gt;: Not quite surprising but pretty intriguing read on how dependent we&amp;rsquo;re on medication these days. Think twice before you pop that pill!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://outline.com/mBnzcp&#34;&gt;Why Astrology matters&lt;/a&gt;: My family (prior generation) was (is?) a strong believer in Astrology. From making birth charts/Horoscopes, wearing different rings on the fingers to influence the &amp;lsquo;stars&amp;rsquo;, matching horoscopes prior to weddings, and most significantly to pick an auspicious time to travel; The sentiment has definitely changed over the last decade or so, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s still there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrology has stood the test of several hundred generations now and there&amp;rsquo;s got to be an iota of truth somewhere out there. That said, I still have an excruciatingly hard time believing that the stars and planets have anything to do with one&amp;rsquo;s life developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5ee9d85ebfadf0.97957728&#34;&gt;Opinion | We’re Banning Facial Recognition. We’re Missing the Point.&lt;/a&gt;: It all boils down to regulation. Or technology that&amp;rsquo;s able to shroud a person&amp;rsquo;s exteriors both physically, electrically and magnetically!&lt;/p&gt;
