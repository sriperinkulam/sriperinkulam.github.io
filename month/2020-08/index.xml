      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Stamp-Collection-e1598479811502-1200x689.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About two decades ago, I chanced upon a small collection of stamps from my Dad. Thanks to friends who were also into stamps then, an amazing mail-man who&amp;rsquo;d collect and pass-on stamps from other countries over to me and not to forget Kitta Mama - our then neighbor; Over the next few years, I was able to increase the collection quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During one of my visits to India in 2018, I digitized my stamps and uploaded them over to my personal home server. Today, while looking for something else, I came across them and decided to organize them in a gallery. I really like how it&amp;rsquo;s turned out and it&amp;rsquo;s sort of re-kindled my interest in philately! Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gallery.srkn.org/#15984761657331&#34;&gt;digitized collection&lt;/a&gt; sorted by country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kitta Mama was Appa&amp;rsquo;s senior at work and our neighbor. He was well into his 70s and on those hot summer days, when we - the kids from the neighborhood would take a break from our outdoor play, he would tell us tales of his escape from Burma during the World War II. My interest in Geography and History grew solely because of him. He&amp;rsquo;s also the one who introduced us to his &lt;a href=&#34;https://srikanthperinkulam.com/2017/03/25/millebornes/&#34;&gt;mega-collection of board games&lt;/a&gt;! One fine day in January 2000, he volunteered to drive me on his moped, to the Hospital where Amma was reeling back and forth in Coma. A speeding white ambassador accidentally(?) hit us from the rear and drove away from the scene. I was able to get him to the hospital but just not in time to save him. Those moments are etched in my memory forever and this gallery is a tribute to him and his never ending zeal to convey positivity, knowledge and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eyes on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html&#34;&gt;Intel NUC&lt;/a&gt; for a while now. My current laptop has been on a downward spiral and a few days back, when I came across a fabulous deal on eBay for an unboxed but unused NUC, I took the dive and ordered it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 16GB RAM, 256GB NVMe SSD, 8TH Gen Core i7 Pro processor and Windows 10 Pro pre-installed - This is the most powerful machine I&amp;rsquo;ve owned. Agreed speed and performance is all relative. I&amp;rsquo;m just amazed that all of this fits in a tiny 4&amp;quot;x 4&amp;quot;x 1&amp;quot; box!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/odfywNUIw08ldUgYLl3wgoarJq9gnPRPxRJ7JXbY.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While at it, I also decided to switch over from &lt;a href=&#34;https://elementary.io/&#34;&gt;ElementaryOS&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://pop.system76.com/&#34;&gt;PopOS&lt;/a&gt;. The PopOS install was a breeze. After a quick drive-partition all it took was probably a couple minutes to install the OS! Super impressed with the UI and the tiling feature on large screens is crisp!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
