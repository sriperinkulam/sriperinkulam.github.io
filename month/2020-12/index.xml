      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so glad I moved out of the Apple ecosystem a few years back. Was good while I was using it and now that I&amp;rsquo;m off, I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow or have the urge to upgrade to the next in-thing. It is liberating and I guess - to each his own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely love such &amp;lsquo;meandering&amp;rsquo; posts! You never know what you&amp;rsquo;re going to be reading in the next para and the heading can only do justice to a specific section.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meandering through &lt;a href=&#34;https://berthub.eu/index.html&#34;&gt;Bert&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s webpage and a few other sites - Such a treasure trove of information on the C-19 vaccine and biology/technology in general. No seriously, dive into these links for some great layman(ish) explanation of DNA, RNA, Vaccines and what not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3c8962f2a2.96282489&#34;&gt;Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea38322bb2a0.08041300&#34;&gt;No, Really, mRNA Vaccines Are Not Going To Affect Your DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3d3bb2ac73.65468826&#34;&gt;The story of mRNA: From a loose idea to a tool that may help curb Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/share/5fea3e5f534579.64795290&#34;&gt;I Made a Covid-19 Vaccine in my Kitchen and it Worked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: These links point to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bag.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;Wallabag instance&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d much prefer linking to the original article. However, I find this as a good way to save information which I can access later even if the original source vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christmas plan for this year was a major blooper. With the long weekend and everybody off work, we had initially planned to head down south to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covelong&#34;&gt;Covelong&lt;/a&gt;. The sisters and I would take on surfing classes while my in-laws and Shasta would have some down-time by the beach. We&amp;rsquo;d scoped out Sea la vie, as a decent place to stay during the three days there and confirmed they had sufficient C-19 measures in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on reaching there on the 25th Morning, we were appalled at the lack of basic containment measures. None of the guests and even more alarmingly - none of the staff were wearing masks or taking any preventive measures. We immediately cancelled our stay there and head over to Fishermans&amp;rsquo; cove to check if they&amp;rsquo;d have any rooms available - which they obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t! Got a few beverages, spent some time on the beach and head back home stopping over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://annalakshmichennai.com/&#34;&gt;Annalakshmi&lt;/a&gt; for a delectable and sumptuous lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a terrific intro to all things linux and the terminal. Something I wish I&amp;rsquo;d come across when I was learning the ropes several years ago. I&amp;rsquo;d almost forgotten about &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I chanced on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web&#34;&gt;Calibre-Web&lt;/a&gt; last week and finally got around better organizing my book collection. I really like the way it&amp;rsquo;s turned out and if anything, this has been a silent nudge to read more and read frequently! The beauty of this is that, I can now share my collection with friends and family just like yesteryear&amp;rsquo;s - when you would just borrow a book from a friend, read it and return it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/Screenshot-from-2020-12-21-04-47-49.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection is now available here - &lt;a href=&#34;https://lib.srkn.org/&#34;&gt;The Perinkulam Library&lt;/a&gt;. If there&amp;rsquo;s a book that you find interesting, let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to setup a guest account for you to read!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had to turn on images in a particular e-mail to read a specific piece of content which I thought was interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s alarming and rather obscene how images are used in certain newsletters to convey a simple wall of text. Thanks, no thanks - I&amp;rsquo;m unsubscribing right away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we&amp;rsquo;re on that topic, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://postale.io/&#34;&gt;postale.io&lt;/a&gt; for about a couple months now and absolutely love it! Setting it up was a breeze and the web-front is refreshingly clean!&lt;/p&gt;
