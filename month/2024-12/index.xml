      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got some decent progress on tweaking this portal. All hugo&amp;rsquo;d out for now though and a short break is overdue. Super slow weekend otherwise. Watched Moana 2. Meh. Not much story but decent visuals. Tragedy of sequels, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moved over the syndication links in my posts to post-meta. The syndication icon only shows up if a valid link is present in the FrontMatter of a post. Once micro.blog picks up the feed, it&amp;rsquo;s currently set to auto publish to the fediverse on my GoToSocial (GTS) instance.  On the backend, a GO script fetches the RSS feed from my GTS instance and saves the RSS feed item link and the corresponding link to my post in a JSON file. Another script quickly looks up which post&amp;rsquo;s FrontMatter needs to be updated for the syndication links in each post and updates the files as needed. A bit windy but seems to do the job for now. I might end up consolidating these into just one script later and/or directly use the masto API to publish to the fediverse and grab the syndication link from there. For now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty psyched this is all working.&lt;/p&gt;
