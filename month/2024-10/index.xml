&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being overseas and not having access to firecrackers, this festival is just not what it used to be. I wish I could go back to those days when we would try and wake up before Kitta mama would burst his 1000 wala before the break of dawn. Days when you yearn to wear those new set of clothes - The only time of the year when you get new clothes and not hand-me-downs. Days when you make a TON of sweets and savories to share with family and friends. Days when you would hop into people&amp;rsquo;s houses uninvited to see what special delicacy they&amp;rsquo;ve made. Days when every single house is lit up and the smoke of firecrackers permeate everything. Such good memories&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diwali this year was super low key. We did light up some &lt;em&gt;Diyas&lt;/em&gt; and M had ordered some savory snacks from one of her local contacts. A few calls to family and I think we called it a day. Times when you miss being amongst family and friends. Happy Halloween and Diwali - I guess?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, WordPress has been home to most of my digital presence. Sometime last week one of the plugins – Wordfence, I think – took a major dump and nuked my site down. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite see that coming but I take that as a sign for me to change things up a bit. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to test out WriteFreely for a while now and this might be just about the right opportunity. I&amp;rsquo;m not quite suew how I want to handle the migration. For now though, it&amp;rsquo;s a brand new shiny slate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a couple days off work for a short break. M flagged a quick trip to the Tula ruins. Just about a couple hours from the city, these ruins were a nice quick visit. There was barely anybody out here as opposed to the crowds at the Teotihuacán pyramids. On the way back we did a quick stop in Tepozotlan for brunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back in the city, S wanted to roller blade and we head to Parque Americana for some good wheel time. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we got these rollers! I&amp;rsquo;m definitely getting better at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took the bike out for a spin right after the CLO trick or treat. Reforma and parts of Centro Historico were closed out for the monthly night ride and this one coincided with Dia de muertos. Quite a few people showed up and most of the route was a huge bicycle jam. Nevertheless some good time out on the roads in the nippy weather. Clocked around 11 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent a good few hours out in the woods along with the girl scouts. M is not a leader this year so we took a step back and had a great time just enjoying the outdoors. S had a slow start and was heavily resisting for the first hour or so. She suddenly flipped once we reached the mid point and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to stop! She clocked around 5.2 miles in 3 hours and this would be one of her longest hikes in quite some time now! Super proud and she did earn her ramen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waterfall and the trail per se were beautiful with quite a few switchbacks on the stream fed by melt water from the Iztaccihuatl volcano. The approach road to the trail-head was quite beaten and the Vitara handled it real well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back from a week long trip from Matamoros. It felt much safer this trip with a significant lack of federales presence. Until last Saturday. Locals were getting ransom calls from the cartel and we decided to operate from Brownsville instead. Otherwise a pretty uneventful yet productive trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had to wait for a good thirty minutes for the bus to shuttle us to the terminal. Not complaining one bit though. There’s a mild nip in the air. Feels SO GOOD to be back in this beautiful valley. Izta and Popo are snow capped now. So freaking beautiful. Maybe I should head out for a hike this weekend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgot my phone in the Uber on the way back from the airport. Ouch! Thankfully was able to reach the driver and he promised to get it back to me the next day. Come Friday, he said he was held up the whole day with family events but would deliver it on Saturday. Almost rescinded to the fact that I was looking at getting a new phone. He showed up as promised the next day and apologized for not making it yesterday. Super guilty of moments of fluctuating human trust…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brought home the Thinkpad 480s that I had ordered a couple weeks ago. Refurbished machine for about 320USD. Seems good so far. This along with the Samsung Soundbar that I got for 50USD from someone in the community have been my latest tech indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;amp;S are out for a birthday party and I have some good chunk of hours for myself. My digital tinker list is long but I’m not really in the mood to sit in front of the screen. A good feeling I guess? I turn the soundbar on random shuffle and work off tangible things on M’s list. Some hot glue here, a few stitches there. Each task barely takes a few minutes but so very satisfying. Time in hand and tasks not really in mind. Music in the background. I’m kinda liking this slow weekend. Looking forward to Ladek’s performance tonight!&lt;/p&gt;
